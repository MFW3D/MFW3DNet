The presence of this element says to aggregators that they only have to read the changes file to see if this feed has updated. If several feeds point to the same changes file, the aggregator has to do less polling, resulting in better use of server bandwidth, and the Internet as a whole; and resulting in faster scans. Everyone wins. For more technical information, see the howto on the XML-RPC site.
