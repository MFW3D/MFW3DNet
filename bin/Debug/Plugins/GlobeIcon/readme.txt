What
----

The GlobeIcon plugin displays a mini globe showing you current location 
and an optional top view window. 

The plugin appears as a layer in the Layer Manager (key L).
Right click on the layer for settings.

Settings allow you to select various size and placements for the globe 
and top view. 

All settings are saved.

Install
-------

1. You need WW 1.4 or above.

2. Unzip in your WW Plugins directory. That should add a folder named 'GlobeIcon'.
	Note: if you dont already have a 'Plugins' directory inside 
	Program Files/Nasa/WorldWind 1.3, then create one.

3. Start WW and the new plugin should be listed in Plug-ins->Load/Unload. 
	Select the plugin and click 'Load'. It should turn green.

4. Once loaded, it becomes a layer in the Layer Manager (key L)

5. Right Click on the layer for settings (properties)

Uninstall
---------

1. Delete the directory
	Program Files/NASA/World Wind 1.3/Plugins/GlobeIcon 

Notes
-----

* Open source, public domain

This plugin is not compiled and its source can be found in GlobeIcon.cs.
Feel free to use, abuse, divert and copy any part of it. Thats how I got started.

Many thanks to the WorldWind community for their efforts and feedback, 
especialy Bjorn Reppen (http://www.mashiharu.com/) for his plugin architecture, 
usefull tips and inspiring examples.
