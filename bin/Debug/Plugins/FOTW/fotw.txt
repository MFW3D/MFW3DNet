Aruba	aa	Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry. Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence was halted at Aruba's request in 1990.   	12.5	-69.9666666666667	 193	68.5	10.53	0.01	71891	38.5	0.44	11.03	6.68		1.05	1.05	0.95	0.69	0.93	5.79	6.6	4.95	79.28	75.95	82.78	1.79				97	2130000000		3.5	21800	41500							3.8	135800000	147000000			770000000	716100000	0	0	2363	6500			0	0			80000000	875000000	453000000	37100	53000	18	50000	1	20000	5420		24000	1	1 				800			
Antigua and Barbuda	ac	The Siboney were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the islands when Columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by the Spanish and French were succeeded by the English who formed a colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run the sugar plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1981.   	17.05	-61.8	 442.6	153	18.18		69108	30	0.55	16.93	5.37	-6.08	1.05	1.04	1.01	0.61	1	18.86	22.71	14.82	72.16	69.78	74.66	2.24				85.8	750000000		3	11000	30000 	7	11	82				0.4	123700000	145900000		6	100000000	93000000	0	0	0	3600			0	0					231000000	38000	54000	6	36000	2	31000	2143	16	20000	3	2 	1 			1165			
United Arab Emirates	ae	The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West European nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and its moderate foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a vital role in the affairs of the region.   	24	54	 82880	1318	0.77	760	2602713	28.1	1.52	18.96	4.4	0.66	1.05	1.04	1.55	2.73	1.43	14.09	16.57	11.48	75.44	72.92	78.08	2.88	0.18			77.9	111300000000	98100000000	6.7	43400	2800000	7	15	78				10.5	34930000000	29410000000	17.5	4	45120000000	38320000000	0	0	2396000	310000	2500000	0	44790000000	37880000000	7190000000	0	103100000000	60150000000	34470000000	1187700	3683100	23	820000	15	310000	118495	1	1384800	37	23 	14 	4		1088	1600000000	3.1	
Afghanistan	af	Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime, but withdrew 10 years later under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A civil war between mujahedin factions erupted following the 1992 fall of the Communist regime. The Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy, seized Kabul in 1996 and most of the country outside of opposition Northern Alliance strongholds by 1998. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. In late 2001, a conference in Bonn, Germany, established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution and a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. On 7 December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The National Assembly was inaugurated on 19 December 2005.   	33	65	 647500		12.13	27200	31056997	17.6	2.67	46.6	20.34	0.42	1.05	1.05	1.05	0.95	1.05	160.23	164.77	155.45	43.34	43.16	43.53	6.69	0.01			36	21500000000		8	800	15000000	80	10	10	53			16.3	269000000	561000000			905000000	1042000000	0	200000000	0	5000			50000000	50000000	0	0			8000000	50000	600000	45	167000	10	100000	76	1	25000	46	11 	35 	9		34789	122400000	1.7	
Algeria	ag	After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crack down on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but did not appease the activists who progressively widened their attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term, including the ethnic minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing - although significantly degraded - activities of extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its petroleum-based economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has not been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure problems. 	28	3	 2381740	998	3.17	5690	32930091	24.9	1.22	17.14	4.61	-0.35	1.05	1.04	1.02	0.88	1.02	29.87	33.62	25.94	73.26	71.68	74.92	1.89	0.1	9100	500	70	233200000000	85310000000	6	7200	10150000				25	2.8	26.8	1.9	42050000000	30750000000	30.2	8	26990000000	24900000000	400000000	200000000	1373000	246000	1127000	0	82400000000	21320000000	57980000000	0	49590000000	22530000000	19450000000	2288000	13661000	34	7100000	46	3100000	1175	2	845000	142	52 	90 	1	3973	104000	3000000000	3.2	
Azerbaijan	aj	Azerbaijan - a nation with a Turkic and majority-Muslim population - was briefly independent from 1918 to 1920; it regained its independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with Armenia over the Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh enclave (largely Armenian populated). Azerbaijan has lost 16% of its territory and must support some 528,000 internally displaced persons as a result of the conflict. Corruption is ubiquitous, and the promise of widespread wealth from Azerbaijan's undeveloped petroleum resources remains largely unfulfilled.   	40.5	47.5	 86600		20.62	14550	7961619	27.7	0.66	20.74	9.75	-4.38	1.05	1.04	0.95	0.65	0.94	79	81.08	76.81	63.85	59.78	68.13	2.46	0.1	1400	100	98.8	37920000000	10400000000	26.4	4800	5450000	41	7	52	49	2.8	27.8	9.6	3180000000	2986000000	11.3	40	20000000000	20250000000	700000000	2350000000	477000	123000			5130000000	9200000000	0	1000000000	6117000000	4656000000	1873000000	1025400	1456500	28	175000	2	170000	460	2	408000	36	27 	9 	1	2957	27016	121000000	2.6	
Albania	al	Between 1990 and 1992 Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime and corruption, promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size of government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition of power, was considered an important step forward. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure. Albania has played a largely helpful role in managing inter-ethnic tensions in southeastern Europe, and is continuing to work toward joining NATO and the EU. Albania, with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a strong supporter of the global war on terrorism.   	41	20	 28748	362	20.1	3530	3581655	28.9	0.52	15.11	5.22	-4.67	1.1	1.1	1.05	0.86	1.04	20.75	21.2	20.27	77.43	74.78	80.34	2.03				86.5		8657000000	5.5	4900	1090000	58	19	23	25			2.4	1960000000	2377000		3.1	5680000000	6760000000	200000000	1080000000	3600	25200	0	21600	30000000	30000000	0	0	650100000	2473000000	1550000000	255000	1100000	60	1000000	65	700000	749	10	75000	11	3 	8 	1	447	18000	56500000	1.49	
Armenia	am	Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Muslim Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. Turkey imposed an economic blockade on Armenia and closed the common border because of the Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.   	40	45	 29800		16.78	2860	2976372	30.4	-0.19	12.07	8.23	-5.72	1.17	1.12	0.88	0.67	0.9	22.47	27.59	16.51	71.84	68.25	76.02	1.33	0.1	2600	200	98.6	13460000000	4868000000	13.9	4500	1200000	45	25	30	43	1.6	41.3	0.6	786100000	930700000		7.5	6317000000	4374000000	650000000	463000000	0	40000			0	1685000000	0	1685000000	800000000	1500000000	1819000000	582500	203300	16	850000	3	825000	8852	9	150000	13	11 	2 		845	7633	135000000	6.5	
Andorra	an	For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607 onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Urgel). In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of state retained, but the government transformed into a parliamentary democracy. Long isolated and impoverished, mountainous Andorra achieved considerable prosperity since World War II through its tourist industry. Many immigrants (legal and illegal) are attracted to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes.   	42.5	1.5	 468		2.13		71201	40.9	0.89	8.71	6.25	6.47	1.07	1.09	1.1	0.98	1.08	4.04	4.38	3.68	83.51	80.61	86.61	1.3				100	1840000000		4	24000	48740	0.34	19.63	80.03				3.4	373500000	373500000															145000000			35000	51900	15	16000	0	27000	7058	1	11000						269			
Angola	ao	Angola is slowly rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but UNITA renewed fighting after being beaten by the MPLA at the polls. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - in the quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and strengthened the MPLA's hold on power. DOS SANTOS has pledged to hold legislative elections in 2006.   	-12.5	18.5	 1246700	1600	2.65	800	12127071	18	2.45	45.11	24.2	3.55	1.05	1.02	1.03	0.8	1.02	185.36	197.56	172.54	38.62	37.47	39.83	6.35	3.9	240000	21000	66.8	45930000000	24350000000	19.1	3200	5580000	85	15	15	70			23	8500000000	10000000	38.3	13.5	2240000000	1900000000	0	0	1600000	46000			720000000	720000000	0	0	26800000000	8165000000	9401000000	96300	1094100	34	815000	6	196000	2502	1	172000	244	31 	213 		2761	51429	2000000000	8.8	
American Samoa	aq	Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was "discovered" by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.   	-14.3333333333333	-170	 199	116	10		57794	23.2	-0.19	22.46	3.27	-21.11	1.06	1.08	1.08	0.59	1.06	9.07	9.66	8.45	76.05	72.48	79.82	3.16				97	500000000			5800	30200	34	33	33					121000000	127000000			130000000	120900000	0	0	0	4000			0	0						15000	2377	5	57000	1	14000	1430	1		3	2 	1 			185			
Argentina	ar	Following independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina experienced periods of internal political conflict between conservatives and liberals and between civilian and military factions. After World War II, a long period of Peronist authoritarian rule and interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the resignation of several interim presidents.   	-34	-64	 2766890	4989	10.03	15500	39921833	29.7	0.96	16.73	7.55	0.4	1.05	1.05	1	0.7	0.97	14.73	16.58	12.78	76.12	72.38	80.05	2.16	0.7	130000	1500	97.1	518100000000	182000000000	8.7	13100	15340000				38.5			9.6	42630000000	39980000000	72.5	7.7	87160000000	82970000000	2070000000	1561000000	745000	450000			41040000000	34580000000	6050000000	0	40000000000	28800000000	118200000000	8700000	13512400	266	24300000	42	7950000	1233175	33	10000000	1381	154 	1,227 		31902	229144	4300000000	1.3	
Australia	as	Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain. Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Long-term concerns include pollution, particularly depletion of the ozone layer, and management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.   	-27	133	 7686850	25760	6.15	25450	20264082	36.9	0.85	12.14	7.51	3.85	1.05	1.05	1.02	0.79	0.99	4.63	5.02	4.22	80.5	77.64	83.52	1.76	0.1	14000	200	99	640100000000	612800000000	2.5	31900	10420000	3.6	21.2	75.2		2	25.4	2.7	249800000000	240200000000	16.1	1.1	237000000000	221000000000	0	0	530000	875600	523400	530800	35600000000	25080000000	9744000000	0			323400000000	11660000	16480000	608	25500000	104	10150000	5351622	571	14189544	455	311 	144 	1	47738	810641	17840000000	2.7	
Ashmore and Cartier Islands	at	These uninhabited islands came under Australian authority in 1931; formal administration began two years later. Ashmore Reef supports a rich and diverse avian and marine habitat; in 1983, it became a National Nature Reserve. Cartier Island, a former bombing range, is now a marine reserve.   	-12.2333333333333	123.083333333333	 5	74.1		0																																																																							
Austria	au	Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995, some Austrians have called into question this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.   	47.3333333333333	13.3333333333333	 83870		16.59	40	8192880	40.9	0.09	8.74	9.76	1.94	1.05	1.05	1.01	0.68	0.95	4.6	5.65	3.5	79.07	76.17	82.11	1.36	0.3	10000	100	98	267600000000	293400000000	1.9	32700	3490000	3	27	70	5.9	3.3	22.5	2.3	148600000000	154500000000	65.1	4.7	63690000000	64780000000	13530000000	16630000000	17810	249000	30140	152600	1960000000	9010000000	0	7050000000	122500000000	118800000000	510600000000	3791000	7990000	68	6080000	10	4250000	1812776	37	4650000	55	25 	30 	1	6011	133718	1497000000	0.9	
Anguilla	av	Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated into a single British dependency, along with Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency.   	18.25	-63.1666666666667	 102	61			13477	31.2	1.57	14.17	5.34	6.9	1.03	1.03	1.06	0.81	1.03	20.32	26.67	13.79	77.28	74.35	80.3	1.73				95	112000000		2.8	7500	6049				23			2.3	22800000	22500000		3.1		42600000													8800000	6200	1800	9	3000	1	1000	395	16	3000	3	1 	2 			105

The southernmost and smallest of these is the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area, which is also referred to as the Western Sovereign Base Area.   	34.6166666666667	32.9666666666667	 123	56.3																																																										0															
Antarctica		Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands. Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century. Following World War II, there was an upsurge in scientific research on the continent. A number of countries have set up year-round research stations on Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but not all countries recognize these claims. In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it entered into force in 1961.   	-90	0	14000000	17968																																																								0; note - information for US bases only		3			several hundred at McMurdo Station	8018					28 	37 					
Bahrain	ba	Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has transformed itself into an international banking center. Sheikh HAMAD bin Isa Al Khalifa, who came to power in 1999, has pushed economic and political reforms and has worked to improve relations with the Shi'a community. In February 2001, Bahraini voters approved a referendum on the National Action Charter - the centerpiece of Sheikh HAMAD's political liberalization program. In February 2002, Sheikh HAMAD pronounced Bahrain a constitutional monarchy and changed his status from amir to king. In October 2002, Bahrainis elected members of the lower house of Bahrain's reconstituted bicameral legislature, the National Assembly.   	26	50.55	 665	161	2.82	40	698585	29.4	1.45	17.8	4.14	0.82	1.03	1.02	1.38	1.07	1.26	16.8	19.65	13.87	74.45	71.97	77	2.6	0.2	600	200	89.1	15830000000	11010000000	5.9	23000	380000 	1	79	20				2.7	4662000000	3447000	33.5	2	7345000000	6830000000	0	0	188300	26000			9650000000	9650000000	0	0			6814000000	191600	649800	5	338000	4	275000	1952	1	152700	3	3 		1		3498	627700000	4.9	
Barbados	bb	The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in 1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.   	13.1666666666667	-59.5333333333333	 431	97	37.21	50	279912	34.6	0.37	12.71	8.67	-0.31	1.01	1	0.97	0.62	0.94	11.77	13.38	10.15	72.79	70.79	74.82	1.65	1.5	2500	200	99.7	4745000000	2964000000	4.1	17000	128500	10	15	75				-0.5	847000000	886000000		-3.2	819000000	761700000	0	0	1000	10000			29170000	29170000	0	0			668000000	135700	200100	8	237000	1	76000	241	19	150000	1	1 				1600			
Botswana	bc	Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.   	-22	24	 600370		0.65	10	1639833	19.4	-0.04	23.08	29.5	6.07	1.03	1.03	0.94	0.61	0.96	53.7	54.92	52.44	33.74	33.9	33.56	2.79	37.3	350000	33000	79.8	17240000000	9046000000	4.5	10500	288400				30.3			8.6	3766000000	3767000000	6.2	7.5	891000000	2641000000	0	1390000000	0	12000		16000	0	0			3680000000	3370000000	519000000	136500	823100	25	252720	1	31000	1621	11	60000	85	10 	75 		888	25233	325500000	3.4	
Bermuda	bd	Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists headed for Virginia. Tourism to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. Although a referendum on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995, the present government has reopened debate on the issue.   	32.3333333333333	-64.75	 53.3	103	20		65773	40.2	0.61	11.4	7.74	2.4	1.02	1.01	0.98	0.77	0.96	8.3	9.85	6.73	77.96	75.85	80.1	1.89	0.297	163	392	98	4500000000		4.6	69900	38360				19			2.8	738000000	665000000			682500000	616700000	0	0	0	4658			0	0					160000000	56000	49000	8	82000	3	66000	12286	20	39000	1	1 				447	4030000	0.11	
Belgium	be	Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy.   	50.8333333333333	4	 30528	66.5	27.42	400	10379067	40.9	0.13	10.38	10.27	1.22	1.05	1.04	1.02	0.7	0.96	4.62	5.2	4.01	78.77	75.59	82.09	1.64	0.2	10000	100	99	325000000000	350300000000	1.5	31400	4770000	1.3	24.5	74.2	4	3.2	23	2.8	180400000000	180500000000	94.3	-0.2	78770000000	79660000000	8300000000	14700000000	13060	624200	450000	1042000	0	15480000000	0	15400000000	269600000000	264500000000	980100000000	4801000	9131700	0	8075000	25	4720000	2238900	61	5100000	43	25 	18 	1	3521	149757	3999000000	1.3	
The Bahamas	bf	Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher Columbus first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony in 1783. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas have prospered through tourism and international banking and investment management. Because of its geography, the country is a major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments to the US, and its territory is used for smuggling illegal migrants into the US.   	24.25	-76	 13940	3542	0.58	10	303770	27.8	0.64	17.57	9.05	-2.17	1.02	1	0.97	0.69	0.96	24.68	30.29	18.96	65.6	62.24	69.03	2.18	3	5600	200	95.6	6098000000	5783000000	3.5	20200	176300				9.3		27	1.2	1030000000	1030000			1810000000	1683000000	0	0	0	23000	29000		0	0					342600000	139900	186000	8	215000	2	67000	359	19	93000	64	29 	35 	1		2693

Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina	bk	Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a declaration of independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that brought to a halt three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government charged with conducting foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government comprised of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments were charged with overseeing most government functions. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) was established to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities. European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced SFOR in December 2004; their mission is to maintain peace and stability throughout the country.   	44	18	 51129	20	19.61	30	4498976	38.4	1.35	8.77	8.27	13.01	1.07	1.07	1.02	0.7	0.97	9.82	11.26	8.28	78	74.39	81.88	1.22	0.1	900	100	94.6		8495000000	5.3	6800	1026000				25			4.4	4373000000	4401000000		5.5	10510000000	8849000000	3200000000	2271000000	0	21000			0	160000000	0	300000000	2700000000	6800000000	3116000000	928000	1050000	25	940000			8525	3	225000	28	8 	20 	5	608	21846	234300000	4.5	
Bolivia	bl	Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups. Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's traditional political class and empower the nation's poor majority.   	-17	-65	 1098580		2.78	1320	8989046	21.8	1.45	23.3	7.53	-1.22	1.05	1.04	0.96	0.8	0.98	51.77	55.31	48.05	65.84	63.21	68.61	2.85	0.1	4900	500	87.2	25950000000	9657000000	4	2900	4220000				64	1.3	32	5.4	2848000000	3189000		5.7	4250000000	3963000000	0	10000000	42000	48000			6720000000	1740000000	2900000000	0	2371000000	1845000000	6309000000	625400	1800800	321	5250000	48	900000	16045	9	350000	1084	16 	1,068 		3519	60762	130000000	1.4	
Burma	bm	Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate, self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and later as political kingpin. Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory, the ruling junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest, where she remains virtually incommunicado. In November 2005, the junta extended her detention for at least another six months. Her supporters, as well as all those who promote democracy and improved human rights, are routinely harassed or jailed.   	22	98	 678500	1930	14.92	18700	47382633	27	0.81	17.91	9.83		1.06	1.02	0.97	0.76	0.97	61.85	72.68	50.38	60.97	58.07	64.03	1.98	1.2	330000	20000	85.3	78740000000	7464000000	2.9	1700	27750000	70	7	23	25	2.8	32.4	20.2	473300000	716600000			7393000000	6875000000	0	0	18500	32000	3356	49230	9980000000	1569000000	8424000000	0	3111000000	3454000000	6990000000	424900	92500	0	4200000	2	320000	43		63700	85	21 	64 	1	3955	27000	39000000	2.1	
Benin	bn	Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960, as the Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were alleged.   	9.5	2.25	 112620	121	23.53	120	7862944	17.6	2.73	38.85	12.22	0.67	1.03	1.02	0.97	0.69	0.98	79.56	84.09	74.88	53.04	51.9	54.22	5.2	1.9	68000	5800	33.6	8553000000	4340000000	3.5	1100					33			3.5	766800000	1017000000		8.3	69000000	538200000	0	474000000	400	12000			0	0			826900000	1043000000	1600000000	72800	75100	15	660000	1	66000	814	4	100000	5	1 	4 		578	16000	100900000	2.3	
Belarus	bo	After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Alexander LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion continue.   	53	28	 207600		26.77	1310	10293011	37.2	-0.06	11.16	14.02	2.3	1.05	1.04	0.95	0.5	0.88	13	13.92	12.03	69.08	63.47	74.98	1.43	0.3	15000	1000	99.6	70680000000	26690000000	8	6900	4300000	14	34.7	51.3	27.1	5.1	20	10.3	5903000000	6343000		15.6	30000000000	34300000000	800000000	7000000000	36000	252000	14500	360000	250000000	20500000000	0	20500000000	16140000000	16940000000	4662000000	3284300	4098000	76	3020000	47	2520000	20973	23	1600000	86	41 	45 	1	5512	93055	420500000	1.4	
Solomon Islands	bp	The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s. Some of the bitterest fighting of World War II occurred on this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. Ethnic violence, government malfeasance, and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003, Prime Minister Sir Allen KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the following month, an Australian-led multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has been very effective in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.   	-8	159	 28450	5313	0.62		552438	18.9	2.61	30.01	3.92		1.05	1.04	1.02	0.92	1.03	20.63	23.54	17.59	72.91	70.4	75.55	3.91					800000000		5.8	1700	26840	75	5	20				10	49700000	75100000			55000000	51150000	0	0	0	1270			0	0			171000000	159000000	180400000	6200	1500	3	57000		3000	740	1	8400	35	2 	33 			1360			
Navassa Island	bq	This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857 for its guano. Mining took place between 1865 and 1898. The lighthouse, built in 1917, was shut down in 1996 and administration of Navassa Island transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department of the Interior. A 1998 scientific expedition to the island described it as a unique preserve of Caribbean biodiversity; the following year it became a National Wildlife Refuge and annual scientific expeditions have continued.   	18.4166666666667	-75.0333333333333	 5.4	8																																																																									
Brazil	br	Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal, Brazil became an independent nation in 1822 and a republic in 1889. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil overcame more than half a century of military intervention in the governance of the country when in 1985 the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's leading economic power and a regional leader. Highly unequal income distribution remains a pressing problem.   	-10	-55	 8511965	7491	6.93	29200	188078227	28.2	1.04	16.56	6.17	-0.03	1.05	1.04	0.98	0.7	0.98	28.6	32.3	24.7	71.97	68.02	76.12	1.91	0.7	660000	15000	86.4	1556000000000	619700000000	2.4	8400	90410000	20	14	66	22	0.7	31.27	6.9	140600000000	172400000000	51.6	3.4	387500000000	359600000000	6000000	37400000000	2010000	1610000			15790000000	21740000000	0	5947000000	115100000000	78020000000	188000000000	42382200	65605000	458	71000000	138	36500000	4392693	50	25900000	4276	714 	3,562 	417	29252	1724929	9940000000	1.3

Bhutan	bt	In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land to British India. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. A refugee issue of some 100,000 Bhutanese in Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft constitution - which would introduce major democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for its approval. A referendum date has yet to be named.   	27.5	90.5	 47000		2.3	400	2279723	20.4	2.1	33.65	12.7		1.05	1.07	1.06	1.01	1.07	98.41	96.14	100.79	54.78	55.02	54.53	4.74	0.1	100		47	2900000000		5.3	1400		93	2	5				3	146000000	152000000		9.3	1882000000	250300000	1510000000	10000000	0	1100			0	0			154000000		245000000	30300	22000	10	37000	1	11000	3		20000	2	1 	1 			8050	8290000	1	
Bulgaria	bu	The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. Today, reforms and democratization keep Bulgaria on a path toward eventual integration into the EU. The country joined NATO in 2004.   	43	25	 110910	354	29.94	5880	7385367	40.8	-0.86	9.65	14.27	-4.01	1.06	1.05	0.97	0.7	0.93	19.85	23.52	15.95	72.3	68.68	76.13	1.38	0.1	346	100	98.6	71540000000	25790000000	5.5	9600	3340000	11	32.7	56.3	13.4	4.5	22.8	5	11180000000	10900000000	31.9	7.3	38070000000	31750000000	5449000000	1800000000	2908	107000			1000000	5401000000	0	5800000000	11670000000	15900000000	15320000000	2726800	4729700	96	4510000	39	3310000	95539	200	630000	217	132 	85 	4	4294	102016	356000000	2.6	
Bouvet Island	bv	This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely covered by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom the island was named. No claim was made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were designated a nature reserve. Since 1977, Norway has run an automated meteorological station on the island.   	-54.4333333333333	3.4	 49	29.6		0																																																																							
Brunei	bx	The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and 17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in the developing world.   	4.5	114.666666666667	 5770	161	2.08	10	379444	27.4	1.87	18.79	3.45	3.31	1.06	1.04	1.12	0.91	1.09	12.25	15.46	8.86	75.01	72.57	77.59	2.28	0.1	200	200	93.9	6842000000		1.7	23600	146300 	2.9	61.1	36				0.9	3765000000	4815000000		7.3	2906000000	2726000000	0	0	200800	10770	192700		11400000000	1730000000	9000000000	0	4514000000			90000	137000	0	329000	4	201900	27	2	56000	2	1 	1 	3		2525	290700000	5.1	
Burundi	by	Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. Over 200,000 Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to an integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The new government, led by President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, faces many challenges, particularly from the country's last rebel group who remains outside of the peace process and continue attacks in the western provinces of Burundi.   	-3.5	30	 27830		35.57	210	8090068	16.6	3.7	42.22	13.46	8.22	1.03	1.01	0.99	0.67	0.99	63.13	70.26	55.79	50.81	50.07	51.58	6.55	6	250000	25000	51.6	5654000000	730000000	1.1	700	2990000	93.6	2.3	4.1	68	1.8	32.9	16	215400000	278000000		18	141300000	141400000	0	10000000	0	3000			0	0			52000000	200000000	1200000000	23900	153000	5	440000	1	25000	155	1	25000	8	1 	7 			14480	43900000	5.6	
Canada	ca	A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an unfortified border. Canada's paramount political problem is meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care and education services after a decade of budget cuts. Canada also faces questions about integrity in government following revelations regarding a corruption scandal in the federal government that has helped revive the fortunes of separatists in predominantly francophone Quebec.   	60	-95	 9984670	202080	4.57	7850	33098932	38.9	0.88	10.78	7.8	5.85	1.05	1.05	1.01	0.75	0.98	4.69	5.15	4.22	80.22	76.86	83.74	1.61	0.3	56000	1500	99	1114000000000	1035000000000	2.9	34000	16300000				15.9	2.8	23.8	2.2	159600000000	152600000000	69.6	2.6	566300000000	520900000000	22000000000	33000000000	2400000	2300000	1600000	963000	165800000000	90950000000	91520000000	8730000000	364800000000	317700000000	439800000000	20610000	14984400	833	32300000	80	21500000	3525392	760	20900000	1337	509 	828 	319	48467	1042300	9000000	1.1	
Cambodia	cb	Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863. Cambodia became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the remaining leaders are awaiting trial by a UN-sponsored tribunal for crimes against humanity. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed.   	13	105	 181040	443	20.44	2700	13881427	20.6	1.78	26.9	9.06		1.05	1.02	0.94	0.62	0.95	68.78	77.35	59.84	59.29	57.35	61.32	3.37	2.6	170000	15000	73.6	30650000000	4729000000	6	2200	7000000	75			40	2.9	33.8	5.8	559400000	772000000		22	123700000	115000000	0	0	0	3700			0	0			2663000000	3538000000	800000000	36400	498400	0	1340000	11	94000	1315	2	41000	20	6 	14 	2	602	12323	112000000	3	
Chad	cd	Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution, and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which sporadically flares up despite several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In 2005 new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and have made probing attacks into eastern Chad. Power remains in the hands of an ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits.   	15	19	1284000		2.8	300	9944201	16	2.93	45.73	16.38	-0.11	1.04	1.01	0.92	0.66	0.96	91.45	100.12	82.43	47.52	45.88	49.21	6.25	4.8	200000	18000	47.5	14790000000	4799000000	6	1500		80	20	20	80			3	765200000	653300000		5	120000000	111600000	0	0	225000	1450			0	0			3016000000	749100000	1500000000	13000	210000	11	1670000	1	10000	7	1	60000	52	7 	45 			33400	68950000	1	
Sri Lanka	ce	The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty seized power in the north and established a Tamil kingdom. Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century, the island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. Tens of thousands have died in an ethnic conflict that continues to fester. After two decades of fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam formalized a cease-fire in February 2002, with Norway brokering peace negotiations.   	7	81	 65610	1340	13.96	7430	20222240	29.8	0.78	15.51	6.52	-1.23	1.05	1.05	0.94	0.86	0.96	13.97	15.18	12.7	73.41	70.83	76.12	1.84	0.1	3500	200	92.3	85340000000	21620000000	5.6	4300	8080000	38	17	45	22	3.5	28	11.6	3804000000	5469000000	92.8	8.2	7308000000	6796000000	0	0	0	79000			0	0			6442000000	8370000000	11050000000	1130923	3084845	72	3850000	21	1530000	6025	5	280000	16	14 	2 		1449	97287	606200000	2.6	
Republic of the Congo	cf	Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest. Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will need to hope for new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the long term.   	-1	15	 342000	169	1.45	20	3702314	16.6	2.6	42.57	12.93	-3.62	1.03	1.01	0.98	0.7	0.99	85.29	91	79.41	52.8	51.65	53.98	6.07	4.9	90000	9700	83.8	4631000000	4694000000	8	1300								2.2	1328000000	1065000000		0	343000000	619000000	0	300000000	267100	5200			0	0	0	0	2209000000	806500000	5000000000	13800	490000	9	341000	1	33000	46	1	36000	32	4 	28 		894	12800	85220000	1.4	
Democratic Republic of the Congo	cg	Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several subsequent sham elections, as well as through the use of brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion led by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by an insurrection backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support the Kinshasa regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003; Joseph KABILA remains as president and is joined by four vice presidents representing the former government, former rebel groups, and the political opposition. The transitional government held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005, and plans to hold a series of elections in 2006 to determine the presidency and National Assembly seats.   	0	25	 2345410	37	2.86	110	62660551	16.2	3.07	43.69	13.27	0.23	1.03	1.01	0.99	0.68	0.99	88.62	96.9	80.1	51.46	50.01	52.94	6.45	4.2	1100000	100000	65.5	40670000000	7328000000	6.5	700								9	700000000	750000000			6036000000	4324000000	1300000000	10000000	22000	8300			0	0			1108000000	1319000000	10600000000	10000	2600000	16	18030000	4	6478000	188	1	50000	234	25 	209 		5138	157000	103700000	1.5	
China	ch	For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight.   	35	105	 9596960	14500	14.86	545960	1313973713	32.7	0.59	13.25	6.97	-0.39	1.12	1.13	1.06	0.91	1.06	23.12	20.6	25.94	72.58	70.89	74.46	1.73	0.1	840000	44000	90.9	8859000000000	2225000000000	9.9	6800	791400000	49	22	29	10	2.4	30.4	1.8	392100000000	424300000000	24.4	29.5	2190000000000	2170000000000	10600000000	1546000000	3504000	6391000	340300	3226000	35020000000	33440000000	2790000000	0	752200000000	631800000000	252800000000	311756000	334824000	673	417000000	3240	400000000	187508	3	111000000	486	403 	83 	32	74408	1809829	81480000000	4.3	
Chile	ci	Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while Araucanian Indians inhabited central and southern Chile; the latter were not completely subjugated until the early 1880s. Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-84), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern lands. A three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a dictatorial military regime led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth and have helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.   	-30	-71	 756950	6435	2.62	19000	16134219	30.4	0.94	15.23	5.81		1.05	1.05	1	0.72	0.98	8.58	9.32	7.8	76.77	73.49	80.21	2	0.3	26000	1400	96.2	187100000000	115600000000	6	11300	6300000	13.6	23.4	63	18.2	1.2	47	3.1	29200000000	24750000000	7.5	3.4	45300000000	44130000000	0	2000000000	4000	228000	0	221500	1000000000	7060000000	0	5337000000	38030000000	30090000000	47450000000	3318300	9566600	261	5180000	63	3150000	335445	7	5600000	363	73 	290 		6585	79605	3910000000	3.5

In 1959, the islands became a territory within the Federation of the West Indies, but when the Federation dissolved in 1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency.   	19.5	-80.5	 262	160	3.85		45436	37.2	2.56	12.74	4.89	17.78	1.02	1	0.95	0.89	0.96	8	9.16	6.81	80.07	77.45	82.74	1.9				98	1391000000		1.7	32300	19820	1.4	12.6	86				2.8	265200000	248900000			441900000	411000000	0	0	0	2450			0	0					70000000	38000	17000	5	36000	4	7000	5069	16	9909	3	2 	1 			785			
Cocos (Keeling) Islands	ck	There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. Annexed by the UK in 1857, they were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.   	-12.5	96.8333333333333	 14	26			574		0																																																			287		3	300				2		1	1 				22			
Cameroon	cm	The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon merged in 1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite a slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in the hands of an ethnic oligarchy headed by President Paul BIYA.   	6	12	 475440	402	12.54	260	17340702	18.9	2.04	33.89	13.47		1.03	1.02	1.01	0.86	1.01	63.52	67.38	59.53	51.16	50.98	51.34	4.39	6.9	560000	49000	79	40830000000	15350000000	2.8	2400	6860000	70	13	17	48	1.9	36.6	2	3263000000	2705000000	65.9	4.2	2988000000	2779000000	0	0	82300	23000			0	0			3236000000	2514000000	9168000000	110900	2259000	14	2270000	1	450000	34	1	167000	47	11 	36 		987	80932	230200000	1.5	
Comoros	cn	Comoros has endured 19 coups or attempted coups since gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI seized power. He pledged to resolve the secessionist crisis through a confederal arrangement named the 2000 Fomboni Accord. In December 2001, voters approved a new constitution and presidential elections took place in the spring of 2002. Each island in the archipelago elected its own president and a new union president took office in May 2002.   	-12.1666666666667	44.25	 2170	340	35.87		690948	18.6	2.87	36.93	8.2		1.03	1.01	0.97	0.88	0.99	72.85	81.27	64.19	62.33	60	64.72	5.03	0.12			56.5	441000000	402000000	3	600	144500	80	20	20	60			3	27600000			-2	18000000	16740000	0	0	0	700			0	0			34000000	115000000	232000000	13200	16100	6	90000		1000	6	1	8000	4	4 				880	12870000	3	
Colombia	co	Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela). A 40-year conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups and illegal paramilitary groups - both heavily funded by the drug trade - escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government and violence has been decreasing since about 2002, but insurgents continue attacks against civilians and large swaths of the countryside are under guerrilla influence. Paramilitary groups challenge the insurgents for control of territory and the drug trade. Most paramilitary members have demobilized since 2002 in an ongoing peace process, although their commitment to ceasing illicit activity is unclear. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its municipalities. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their borders.   	4	-72	 1138910	3208	2.01	9000	43593035	26.3	1.46	20.48	5.58	-0.3	1.03	1.02	0.95	0.78	0.96	20.35	24.25	16.31	71.99	68.15	75.96	2.54	0.7	190000	3600	92.5	337500000000	97730000000	5.1	7900	20520000	22.7	18.7	58.5	49.2	7.9	34.3	5	46820000000	48770000000	49.5	3.7	50430000000	48830000000	1082000000	48400000	512400	270000			6080000000	6080000000	0	0	19300000000	18000000000	32350000000	7767000	10400600	515	21000000	60	4590000	386610	18	3585688	984	101 	883 	2	3304	110000	3300000000	3.4

Central African Republic	ct	The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960. After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade. President Ange-Felix PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by unrest, and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE, who established a transitional government. Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the main parties, a wide field of candidates contested the municipal, legislative, and presidential elections held in March and May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The government still does not fully control the countryside, where pockets of lawlessness persist.   	7	21	 622984		3.1	20	4303356	18.4	1.53	33.91	18.65		1.03	1.01	0.98	0.66	0.98	85.63	92.44	78.61	43.54	43.46	43.62	4.41	13.5	260000	23000	51	4784000000	1462000000	2.2	1100						0.7	47.7	3.6				3	106000000	98580000	0	0	0	2400			0	0			131000000	203000000	1060000000	10000	60000	7	283000	1	18000	13	1	9000	50	3 	47 			23810	16370000	1	
Cuba	cu	The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule, marked initially by neglect, became increasingly repressive, provoking an independence movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. It was US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 that finally overthrew Spanish rule. The subsequent Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence, which was granted in 1902 after a three-year transition period. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron rule has held the regime together since then. Cuba's Communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country is now slowly recovering from a severe economic recession in 1990, following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies, worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place since 1961. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the southwest border - is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard intercepted 2,712 individuals attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in fiscal year 2005.   	21.5	-80	 110860	3735	27.63	8700	11382820	35.9	0.31	11.89	7.22	-1.57	1.06	1.06	1	0.85	0.99	6.22	6.99	5.41	77.41	75.11	79.85	1.66	0.1	3300	200	97	39170000000		8	3500	4600000	21.2	14.4	64.4				7	22110000000	23650000000		5.1	15650000000	13270000000	0	0	72000	205000			704000000	704000000	0	0	2388000000	6916000000	12560000000	768200	75800	225	3900000	58	2640000	1918	5		170	78 	92 		4226	60858	694000000	1.8	
Cape Verde	cv	The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.   	16	-24	 4033	965	11.41	30	420979	19.8	0.64	24.87	6.55	-11.91	1.03	1.02	0.95	0.59	0.95	46.52	51.63	41.26	70.73	67.41	74.15	3.38	0.035	775	225	76.6	2990000000	1128000000	5.5	6200					30			0.4	328100000	393100000			44150000	41060000	0	0	0	1200			0	0			73350000	500000000	325000000	73400	81700	22	100000	1	15000	155	1	25000	7	7 				1350	7180000	0.7	
Cook Islands	cw	Named after Captain COOK, who sighted them in 1770, the islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965 residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are continuing problems.   	-21.2333333333333	-159.766666666667	 240	120	16.67		21388																					95	105000000		7.1	5000	8000	29	15	56				3.2	28000000	27000000		1	28000000	26040000	0	0	0	400			0	0					141000000	6200	1500	2	14000	1	4000	542	3	3600	9	2 	7 			320			
Cyprus	cy	A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish-held area declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," but it is recognized only by Turkey. The latest two-year round of UN-brokered talks - between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reach an agreement to reunite the divided island - ended when the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plan in an April 2004 referendum. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under direct Republic of Cyprus control, and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots. At present, every Cypriot carrying a Cyprus passport has the status of a European citizen; however, EU laws do not apply to north Cyprus. Nicosia continues to oppose EU efforts to establish direct trade and economic links to north Cyprus as a way of encouraging the Turkish Cypriot community to continue to support reunification.   	35	33	 9250 	648	10.81	400	784301	34.9	0.53	12.56	7.68	0.42	1.05	1.04	1.03	0.77	1	7.04	8.74	5.25	77.82	75.44	80.31	1.82	0.1	1000		97.6	16780000000	15400000000	10.6	21500								2.6	6698000000	7122000000	70.3	0.4	0	0	0	0	300	52000			0	0			1237000000	5552000	10530000000	418400	640500	0	310000		248000	46863	6	298000	16	13 	3 	10		14496	384000000	3.8	
Denmark	da	Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is participating in the general political and economic integration of Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973. However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and issues concerning certain justice and home affairs.   	56	10	 43094	7314	52.59	4490	5450661	39.8	0.33	11.13	10.36	2.52	1.06	1.05	1.02	0.75	0.98	4.51	4.54	4.47	77.79	75.49	80.22	1.74	0.2	5000	100	99	188100000000	243400000000	3.4	34600	2900000	3	21	76		2	24	1.8	144000000000	135000000000	37	1.6	43320000000	31680000000	15600000000	7000000000	376900	188300	332100	195000	7965000000	5173000000	3100000000	0	84950000000	74690000000	352900000000	3487800	5168000	357	6020000	26	3121000	2110002	13	3762500	92	28 	64 		2673	72257	3000000	1.5	
Djibouti	dj	The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second and final term in 2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains a significant military presence in the country, but is also developing stronger ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on terrorism.   	11.5	43	 23000	314	0.04	10	486530	18.2	2.02	39.53	19.31		1.03	1.01	1.09	1.02	1.05	102.44	110.07	94.58	43.17	41.86	44.52	5.31	2.9	9100	690	67.9	619000000		3.5	1300	282000				50			2	135000000	182000000		3	240000000	223200000	0	0	0	12000			0	0			250000000	987000000	366000000	11100	34500	3	52000	1	28000	506	1	9000	13	3 	10 		100	2890	29050000	4.3	
Dominica	do	Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.   	15.4166666666667	-61.3333333333333	 754	148	6.67		68910	30.1	-0.08	15.27	6.73	-9.3	1.05	1.02	1.06	0.67	1.01	13.71	18.09	9.11	74.87	71.95	77.93	1.94				94	384000000		-1	5500	25000	40	32	28	30			1	73900000	84400000		-10	69980000	65090000	0	0	0	800			0	0			74000000	234000000	161500000	21000	41800	6	46000	1	6000	446	16	18500	2	2 				780			
Dominica																																																																															
Dominican Republic	dr	Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on his first voyage in 1492, the island of Hispaniola became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821, but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-1961. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962, but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a second term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term.   	19	-70.6666666666667	 48730	1288	22.49	2750	9183984	24.1	1.47	23.22	5.73	-2.79	1.05	1.05	1.04	0.87	1.03	28.25	30.58	25.8	71.73	70.21	73.33	2.83	1.7	88000	7900	84.7	63730000000	18150000000	9.3	7000	2300000	17	24.3	58.7	25	2.1	37.9	4.2	5322000000	5485000000	45.5	2	12600000000	11710000000	0	0	0	128000		129900	0	300000000			5818000000	9747000000	7687000000	936200	2534100	180	1440000	25	770000	81598	24	800000	33	14 	19 		517	12600	0

Ecuador	ec	What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence by 1819 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 25 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period has been marred by political instability. Seven presidents have governed Ecuador since 1996.   	-2	-77.5	 283560	2237	5.71	8650	13547510	23.6	1.5	22.29	4.23	-3.11	1.05	1.04	0.99	0.89	1	22.87	27.42	18.09	76.42	73.55	79.43	2.68	0.3	21000	1700	92.5	56900000000	30700000000	3.9	4300	4600000	8	24	68	41	2	32	2.1	8822000000	8153000000	40.1	2.1	11270000000	10550000000	65000000	140000000	493200	155000	387000		50000000	50000000	0	0			18090000000	1612300	3544200	456	5000000	7	2500000	16217	31	624600	359	98 	261 	1	966	43197	650000000	2	
European Union	ee	Following the two devastating World Wars of the first half of the 20th century, a number of European leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations - France and Germany - both economically and politically. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all Europe, the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of Western Europe. The following year the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, signed the Treaty of Paris.			 3976372	65413.9		131250	456953258		0.15	10	10.1	1.5		1.06	1.01	0.69	0.96	5.1	5.6	4.5	78.3	75.1	81.6	1.47					12180000000000	13310000000000	1.7	28100	218500000	4.4	27.2	67.2		2.8	25.5	2.2				1.3	2925000000000	2711000000000	282600000000	281200000000	3424000	14590000	5322000	15690000	239200000000	465600000000	78100000000	297800000000				238763162	314644700	952		2791		22000414		230097055	3115			93	222293	4634810			
Egypt	eg	The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to ready the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.   	27	30	 1001450	2450	2.92	34220	78887007	24	1.75	22.94	5.23	-0.21	1.05	1.05	1.02	0.74	1.02	31.33	32.04	30.58	71.29	68.77	73.93	2.83	0.1	12000	700	57.7	303500000000	92600000000	4.9	3900	21340000	32	17	51	20	4.4	25	4.9	20290000000	27680000000	104.7	5	84260000000	78160000000	450000000	250000000	700000	566000			27000000000	27000000000	0	0	14330000000	24100000000	35260000000	10400000	14045134	59	20500000		7700000	1702	50	5000000	88	72 	16 	3	5063	64000	2440000000	3.4	
Ireland	ei	Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C. Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. English invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1948 Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement and approved in 1998, is being implemented with some difficulties.   	53	-8	 70280	1448	16.82		4062235	34	1.15	14.45	7.82	4.87	1.07	1.07	1	0.79	0.99	5.31	5.82	4.76	77.73	75.11	80.52	1.86	0.1	2800	100	99	164600000000	188400000000	4.7	41000	2030000	8	29	64	10	2	27.3	2.4	70460000000	69400000000	26.7	3	23410000000	22970000000	0	1200000000	0	175600	27450	178600	673000000	4298000000	0	3384000000	102000000000	65470000000	1049000000000	2019100	3780000	115	2550000	4	1820000	238706	22	2060000	36	15 	21 		3312	95736	700000000	0.9	
Equatorial Guinea	ek	Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996 and 2002 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004 legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years, there have been few improvements in the population's living standards.   	2	10	 28051	296	4.63		540109	18.8	2.05	35.59	15.06		1.03	1.01	0.93	0.77	0.96	89.21	95.22	83.02	49.54	48	51.13	4.55	3.4	5900	370	85.7	25690000000	7644000000	18.6	50200								5	1973000000	711500000		30	29430000	27370000	0	0	420000	1200			1270000000	1270000000	0	0	6727000000	1864000000	353000000	9600	55500	8	180000	1	4000	18	1	5000	4	3 	1 			2880	152200000	2.1	
Estonia	en	After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940, it regained its freedom in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe.

Eritrea	er	Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December 2000. Eritrea currently hosts a UN peacekeeping operation that is monitoring a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone on the border with Ethiopia. An international commission, organized to resolve the border dispute, posted its findings in 2002 but final demarcation is on hold due to Ethiopian objections.   	15	39	 121320	2234	4.78	210	4786994	17.8	2.47	34.33	9.6		1.03	1.01	0.98	0.95	0.99	46.3	52.22	40.2	59.03	57.44	60.66	5.08	2.7	60000	6300	58.6	4471000000	1244000000	2	1000		80	20	20	50			15	248800000	409400000			270900000	251900000	0	0	0	4600			0	0			33580000	676500000	311000000	39300	20000	4	345000	1	1000	1047	5	50000	17	4 	13 		306	4010	220100000	17.7

A 12-year civil war, which cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when the government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for military and political reforms.   	13.8333333333333	-88.9166666666667	 21040	307	31.37	450	6822378	21.8	1.72	26.61	5.78	-3.61	1.05	1.04	0.91	0.8	0.95	24.39	27.27	21.37	71.49	67.88	75.28	3.12	0.7	29000	2200	80.2	31240000000	16520000000	2.8	4700	2810000	17.1	17.1	65.8	36.1	1.4	39.3	4.7	2840000000	3167000000	46.7	1.5	4158000000	4450000000	91000000	473000000	0	40000			0	0					8087000000	887800	1832600	91	2750000	5	600000	4404	4	587500	75	4 	71 	1	283	10029	161700000	1	
Ethiopia	et	Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of the 1936-41 Italian occupation during World War II. In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the 1990's ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. Final demarcation of the boundary is currently on hold due to Ethiopian objections to an international commission's finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to Ethiopia.   	8	38	 1127127		10.01	2900	74777981	17.8	2.31	37.98	14.86		1.03	1.01	1	0.83	1	93.62	103.43	83.51	49.03	47.86	50.24	5.22	4.4	1500000	120000	42.7	62880000000	8819000000	8.9	900		80	8	12	50	3	33.7	11.6	2338000000	2880000		6.7	2058000000	1914000000	0	0	0	27000			0	0			612000000	2722000000	5101000000	435000	178000	9	15200000	1	682000	87	1	113000	84	14 	70 		681	33856	295900000	3.4

Czech Republic	ez	Following the First World War, the closely related Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II, a truncated Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.   	49.75	15.5	 78866		38.82	240	10235455	39.3	-0.06	9.02	10.59	0.97	1.06	1.06	1.01	0.64	0.95	3.89	4.24	3.52	76.22	72.94	79.69	1.21	0.1	2500	10	99	199400000000	109400000000	6	19500	5270000	4	38	58		4.3	22.4	1.9	48160000000	53040000000	25.9	6.3	78180000000	56500000000	26300000000	10100000000	12380	185200	26670	192300	133000000	9623000000	1000000	9521000000	78370000000	76590000000	49140000000	3427700	10782600	352	3159134	150	3405834	819773	300	4800000	121	46 	75 	2	9572	127747	2170000000	1.81

Finland	fi	Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917. During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now on par with Western Europe. As a member of the European Union, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999.   	64	26	 338145	1250	6.54	640	5231372	41.3	0.14	10.45	9.86	0.84	1.04	1.04	1.02	0.66	0.96	3.55	3.86	3.22	78.5	74.99	82.17	1.73	0.1	1500	100	100	161500000000	184200000000	2.2	30900	2610000					4.2	21.6	0.9	99610000000	97140000000	39.6	-2	79610000000	78940000000	7000000000	11900000000	9013	219700	101000	318300	0	5028000000	0	4567000000	67880000000	56450000000	211700000000	2368000	4988000	189	7700000	120	3200000	1503976	3	3286000	148	76 	72 		5741	78189	1800000000	2	
Fiji	fj	Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji, led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE.   	-18	175	 18270	1129	10.95	30	905949	24.6	1.4	22.55	5.65	-2.94	1.05	1.04	1	0.83	1.01	12.3	13.63	10.91	69.82	67.32	72.45	2.73	0.1	600	200	93.7	5380000000	1937000000	1.7	6000	137000	70	30	30	25.5			1.6	427900000	531400000			775700000	721400000	0	0	0	10000			0	0			862000000		188100000	102000	109900	53	541476		88110	1722	2	61000	28	3 	25 		597	3440	36000000	2.2	
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)	fk	Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until 1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.   	-51.75	-59	 12173	1288			2967		2.44																				75000000			25000	1100	95	5	5				3.6	66200000	67900000			22230000	20680000	0	0	0	200			0	0						2400	0	0	1000		1000	103	2	1900	5	2 	3 			440

France	fr	Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a presidential democracy resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier parliamentary democracies. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency, the euro, in January 1999. At present, France is at the forefront of efforts to develop the EU's military capabilities to supplement progress toward an EU foreign policy.   	46	2	 547030	3427	33.46	26000	60876136	39.1	0.35	11.99	9.14	0.66	1.05	1.05	1	0.7	0.95	4.21	4.71	3.69	79.73	76.1	83.54	1.84	0.4	120000	1000	99	1816000000000	2055000000000	1.4	29900	27720000	4.1	24.4	71.5	6.5	2.8	25.1	1.7	1060000000000	1144000000	66.2	0.2	536900000000	433300000000	72200000000	6200000000	76300	2060000	409600	2281000	1566000000	43740000000	1725000000	40260000000	443400000000	473300000000	2826000000000	33870200	44551800	43	55300000	584	34800000	2922040	62	26214174	477	292 	185 	3	29085	891290	45000000000	2.6

Gabon	gb	Only two autocratic presidents have ruled Gabon since independence from France in 1960. The current president of Gabon, El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world - has dominated the contry's political scene for almost four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the presidential elections in 2005 have exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. Gabon's political opposition remains weak, divided, and financially dependent on the current regime. Despite political conditions, a small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable African countries.   	-1	11.75	 267667	885	1.21	70	1424906	18.6	2.13	36.16	12.25	-2.65	1.03	1.01	1	0.71	0.99	54.51	63.65	45.1	54.49	53.21	55.81	4.74	8.1	48000	3000	63.2	9535000000	6697000000	2.1	6800	640000	60	15	25				-0.1	2463000000	1618000	33.6	1.6	1487000000	1383000000	0	0	268900	12250			90000000	90000000	0	0	5813000000	1533000000	3903000000	38700	489400	17	208000	4	63000	310	1	40000	56	11 	45 		814	32333	253500000	3.4	
Georgia	gg	The region of present-day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National Movement Party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence, but this progress has been complicated by two civil conflicts in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. These two territories remain outside the control of the central government and are ruled by de facto, unrecognized governments, supported by Russia. Russian-led peacekeeping operations continue in both regions.

A long series of coups resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981 and a ban on political parties. A new constitution, restoring multiparty politics, was approved in 1992. Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS, head of state since 1981, won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR, who defeated former Vice President Atta MILLS in a free and fair election, succeeded him.   	8	-2	 239460	539	17.54	310	22409572	19.9	2.07	30.52	9.72	-0.11	1.03	1.03	1	0.89	1	55.02	59.56	50.33	58.87	58.07	59.69	3.99	3.1	350000	30000	74.8	54450000000	9413000000	4.3	2500	10620000	60	15	25	31.4	2.2	30.1	15.1	3216000000	3506000000	75.9	3.8	5356000000	5081000000	400000000	500000000	7433	39000			0	0			2911000000	4273000000	6999000000	313300	1695000	52	12500000	10	1900000	384	12	368000	12	7 	5 		953	42623	83650000	0.8	
Gibraltar	gi	Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. Although the current 1969 Constitution for Gibraltar states that the British government will never allow the people of Gibraltar to pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes, a series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks, the Gibraltarian Government set up a referendum in late 2002 in which a majority of the citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since the referendum, tripartite talks have been held with Spain, UK, and Gibraltar.   	36.1333333333333	-5.35	 6.5	12			27928	39.8	0.14	10.74	9.31		1.06	1.05	1.05	0.81	1.01	5.06	5.63	4.46	79.8	76.92	82.83	1.65				above 80	769000000			27900	14800		40	60				1.5	307000000	284000000			106100000	98690000	0	0	0	23500			0	0			271000000			24512	9797	6	37000	1	10000	629	2	6200	1	1 				29			
Grenada	gj	Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the 19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In 1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.   	12.1166666666667	-61.6666666666667	 344	121	5.88		89703	21.7	0.26	22.08	6.88	-12.59	1	1.02	1.13	0.92	1.08	14.27	13.87	14.67	64.87	63.06	66.68	2.34				96	440000000		2.5	5000	42300	24	14	62	32			2.8	85800000	102100000		0.7	159800000	148600000	0	0	0	1800			0	0					196000000	32700	43300	15	57000	2	33000	18	14	8000	3	3 				1127			
Guernsey	gk	The island of Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy, which held sway in both France and England. The islands were the only British soil occupied by German troops in World War II.

Greenland	gl	Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice-capped. Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute over stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament. The law went into effect the following year. Denmark continues to exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs.   	72	-40	 2166086	44087			56361	34	-0.03	15.93	7.84	-8.37	1.02	1.05	1.17	0.9	1.12	15.4	16.73	14.03	69.94	66.36	73.6	2.4		100		100	1100000000		1.8	20000	24500							1.6	646000000	629000000			242200000	225300000	0	0	0	3850			0	0			480000000		25000000	25300	19900	17	30000	1	30000	8775	1	38000	14	9 	5 						
Germany	gm	As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation, Germany remains a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.   	51	9	 357021	2389	33.13	4850	82422299	42.6	-0.02	8.25	10.62	2.18	1.06	1.05	1.04	0.7	0.96	4.12	4.56	3.66	78.8	75.81	81.96	1.39	0.1	43000	1000	99	2504000000000	2730000000000	0.9	30400	43320000	2.8	33.4	63.8		3.6	25.1	2	1249000000000	1362000000000	67.3	2.9	558100000000	510400000000	54100000000	45400000000	158700	2677000	12990	2135000	22220000000	93880000000	7731000000	85020000000	1016000000000	801000000000	3626000000000	54574000	71300000	842	77800000	373	51400000	7657162	200	48722055	554	332 	222 	32	47201	231581	35063000000	1.5

Greece	gr	Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and Communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military dictatorship, which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country, lasted seven years. The 1974 democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the euro zone in 2001.   	39	22	 131940	13676	20.45	14530	10688058	40.8	0.18	9.68	10.24	2.34	1.06	1.06	1	0.79	0.96	5.43	5.97	4.86	79.24	76.72	81.91	1.34	0.2	9100	100	97.5	236800000000	209700000000	3.7	22200	4720000	12	20	68		3	28.3	3.5	94130000000	103400000000	106.8	-0.3	54560000000	53500000000	2100000000	4200000000	5805	435700	84720	468300	27000000	2340000000	0	2018000000	18540000000	48200000000	75180000000	6348800	9305700	118	5020000	36	2540000	414724	27	3800000	82	66 	16 	8	2571	116470	5890000000	4.3	
Guatemala	gt	The Maya civilization flourished in Guatemala and surrounding regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost three centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the conflict, which had left more than 100,000 people dead and had created some 1 million refugees.   	15.5	-90.25	 108890	400	13.22	1300	12293545	18.9	2.27	29.88	5.2	-1.94	1.05	1.04	0.97	0.87	0.99	30.94	33.55	28.2	69.38	67.65	71.18	3.82	1.1	78000	5800	70.6	56860000000	26980000000	3.2	4700	3760000	50	15	35	75	1.6	46	9.1	3374000000	4041000	25.9	4.1	6898000000	6025000000	425000000	35000000	22300	66000	3104		0	0			3940000000	7744000000	5503000000	1132100	3168300	632	835000	26	1323000	40405	5	756000	450	11 	439 		886	14095	169800000	0.5	
Guinea	gv	Guinea has had only two presidents since gaining its independence from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the first president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was reelected in 1998 and again in 2003. Unrest in Sierra Leone and Liberia has spilled over into Guinea on several occasions over the past decade, threatening stability and creating humanitarian emergencies.   	11	-10	 245857	320	4.47	950	9690222	17.7	2.63	41.76	15.48		1.03	1.02	1	0.78	1	90	95.16	84.69	49.5	48.34	50.7	5.79	3.2	140000	9000	35.9	18990000000	3576000000	2	2000	3000000	80	20	20	40	2.6	32	25	305600000	590400000		3.2	775000000	720800000	0	0	0	8400			0	0			612100000	680000000	3460000000	26200	111500	8	357000	6	85000	364	4	46000	16	5 	11 		837	44348	119700000	2.9	
Guyana	gy	Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to black settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. This ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Jane JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001.   	5	-59	 214970	459	2.23	1500	767245	27.4	0.25	18.28	8.28	-7.49	1.05	1.04	1.02	0.75	1.01	32.19	35.8	28.4	65.86	63.21	68.65	2.04	2.5	11000	1100	98.8	3549000000	782000000	-2.5	4600	418000							6.9	320100000	362600000			779000000	724500000	0	0	0	11300			0	0			587200000	681600000	1200000000	102700	104600	7	420000	3	46000	914	3	145000	90	9 	81 		187	7970	6480000	0.9	
Gaza Strip		The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority (PA) as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external and internal security and for public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank began in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but were derailed by a second intifadah that broke out in September 2000. In April 2003 the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. The proposed date for a permanent status agreement has been postponed indefinitely due to violence and accusations that both sides have not followed through on their commitments. Longtime Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT died in November 2004 and Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005, bringing hope of a turning point in the conflict. In February 2005 Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments, focused on security issues, in an effort to move the peace process forward. Progress has been slow because of different interpretations of the verbal agreement by the two sides. In September 2005, Israel withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and four northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless, Israel controls maritime, airspace, and most access to the Gaza Strip. An agreement signed by the PA and Israel in November 2005 authorized the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt under joint PA and Egyptian control, with monitoring provided by the EU.	31.4166666666667	34.3333333333333	 360	40	29	150	1428757	15.8	3.71	39.45	3.8	1.48	1.05	1.05	1.04	0.71	1.04	22.4	23.48	21.27	71.97	70.67	73.34	5.78				91.9	768000000		4.5	600	278000	11.9	18	70.1	81			3	964000000	1340000000					0										270000000		0	357300	974300	8		1			3	160000	2	1 	1 	1					
Haiti	ha	The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola, and in 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean, but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first black republic to declare its independence in 1804. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the departure of President Jean-Betrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays have prompted repeated postponements, and Haiti missed the constitutionally-mandated presidential inauguration date of 7 February 2006.   	19	-72.4166666666667	 27750	1771	28.11	920	8308504	18.2	2.3	36.44	12.17	-1.31	1.03	1.01	0.96	0.79	0.97	71.65	78.01	65.1	53.23	51.89	54.6	4.94	5.6	280000	24000	52.9	14150000000	4321000000	2	1700	3600000	66	9	25	80			15.7	400000000	600800000			546000000	507800000	0	0	0	11800			0	0			390700000	1471000000	1313000000	140000	400000	67	415000	2	38000	3	3	500000	12	4 	8 			4160	25960000	0.9	
Hong Kong	hk	Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 1 July 1997. In this agreement, China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.   	22.25	114.166666666667	 1092	733	5.05	20	6940432	40.7	0.59	7.29	6.29	4.89	1.08	1.1	0.95	0.87	0.96	2.95	3.13	2.75	81.59	78.9	84.5	0.95	0.1	2600	200	93.5	227300000000	172600000000	7.3	32900	3610000							0.9	31310000000	32300000000	1.8	-0.6	37300000000	39220000000	3086000000	9840000000	0	293000			NA	692200000	0	71150000	286300000000		72040000000	3793000	8214000	14	4450000	55	1840000	859926	17	4878713	3	3 		3		1955

Honduras	ho	Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras became an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion in damage.   	15	-86.5	 112090	820	9.53	800	7326496	19.5	2.16	28.24	5.28	-1.39	1.05	1.04	1	0.83	1.01	25.82	29	22.47	69.33	67.75	70.98	3.59	1.8	63000	4100	76.2	20590000000	7812000000	4.2	2900	2540000	34	21	45	53	0.6	42.7	8.8	1693000000	1938000	68.4	7.7	4338000000	4369000000	0	335000000	0	37000			0	0			1726000000	4161000000	5795000000	390100	707200	306	2450000	11	570000	4763	8	223000	116	11 	105 		699	13603	52800000	2.55

Croatia	hr	The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998.   	45.1666666666667	15.5	 56542	5835	25.82	110	4494749	40.3	-0.03	9.61	11.48	1.58	1.06	1.05	0.99	0.62	0.93	6.72	6.7	6.74	74.68	71.03	78.53	1.4	0.1	200	10	98.5	55760000000	34940000000	4	11600	1710000	2.7	32.8	64.5	11	3.4	24.5	3.3	17690000000	19350000000	49.7	5.1	11150000000	15810000000	550000000	5990000000	20500	90000			1850000000	2990000000	0	1080000000	10300000000	18930000000	30620000000	1887600	2553000	119	1510000		1220000	19369	9	1014000	68	23 	45 	2	2726	28344	620000000	2.39	
Hungary	hu	Hungary was part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.   	47	20	 93030		49.58	2300	9981334	38.7	-0.25	9.72	13.11	0.86	1.06	1.06	0.97	0.57	0.91	8.39	9.09	7.64	72.66	68.45	77.14	1.32	0.1	2800	100	99.4	162600000000	106400000000	4.1	16300	4180000	6.2	27.1	66.7	8.6	4.1	20.5	3.6	51400000000	58340000000	58.9	7.3	32210000000	36960000000	7100000000	14100000000	43920	134100	47180	136600	2940000000	14580000000	4000000	9587000000	61750000000	64830000000	66220000000	3577300	8727200	77	7010000	35	4420000	261294	16	3050000	46	20 	26 	5	7937	159568	1080000000	1.75	
Iceland	ic	Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944. Literacy, longevity, income, and social cohesion are first-rate by world standards.   	65	-18	 103000	4970	0.07		299388	34.2	0.87	13.64	6.72	1.74	1.04	1.03	1.03	0.82	1	3.29	3.43	3.14	80.31	78.23	82.48	1.92	0.2	220	100	99	10570000000	13050000000	5.7	35600	165900	10.3	18.3	71.4				4	6995000000	6761000	31.6	14.2	8619000000	8619000000	0	0	0	17280	0	15470	0	0			3215000000		3073000000	190500	290100	4	260000	14	98000	190140	20	225000	98	5 	93 			13028			
Indonesia	id	The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; the islands were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence after Japan's surrender, but it required four years of intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to relinquish its colony. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and home to the world's largest Muslim population. Current issues include: alleviating poverty, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing financial sector reforms, stemming corruption, and holding the military and police accountable for human rights violations. Indonesia was the nation worst hit by the December 2004 tsunami, which particularly affected Aceh province causing over 100,000 deaths and over $4 billion in damage. An additional earthquake in March 2005 created heavy destruction on the island of Nias. Reconstruction in these areas may take up to a decade. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, but it continues to face a low intensity separatist guerilla movement in Papua.   	-5	120	 1919440	54716	11.03	45000	245452739	26.8	1.41	20.34	6.25		1.05	1.04	1	0.77	1	34.39	39.36	29.17	69.87	67.42	72.45	2.4	0.1	110000	2400	87.9	865600000000	270000000000	5.6	3600	94200000	46.5	11.8	41.7	16.7	3.6	28.5	10.5	54300000000	57700000000	49.9	4.8	120200000000	105400000000	0	0	1061000	1084000	431500	345700	83400000000	22500000000	37500000000	0	83640000000	62020000000	135000000000	9990000	30000000	803	31500000	54	13750000	134735	24	18000000	662	159 	503 	23	6458	368360	1300000000	3

India	in	The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world, dates back at least 5,000 years. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto Indian lands about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. Arab incursions starting in the 8th century and Turkish in the 12th were followed by those of European traders, beginning in the late 15th century. By the 19th century, Britain had assumed political control of virtually all Indian lands. Indian armed forces in the British army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU brought independence in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. Despite impressive gains in economic investment and output, India faces pressing problems such as the ongoing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife.   	20	77	 3287590	7000	48.83	558080	1095351995	24.9	1.38	22.01	8.18	-0.07	1.05	1.06	1.07	1.02	1.06	54.63	55.18	54.05	64.71	63.9	65.57	2.73	0.9	5100000	310000	59.5	3611000000000	719800000000	7.6	3300	496400000	60	17	23	25	3.5	33.5	4.2	111200000000	135800000000	53.8	7.9	556800000000	519000000000	187000000	1400000000	785000	2320000	350000	2090000	27100000000	27100000000	0	0	76230000000	113100000000	125500000000	67285000	69193321	312	116000000	562	63000000	787543	43	50600000	341	243 	98 	28	63230	3851440	19040000000	2.5	
British Indian Ocean Territory	io	Established as a territory of the UK in 1965, a number of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) islands were transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius but also to the Seychelles, between 1967 and 1973. In 2000, a British High Court ruling invalidated the local immigration order that had excluded them from the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.   	-6	71.5	 54400	698		0																																																								3		1		49	1		1	1

Iran	ir	Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and the shah was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority nominally vested in a learned religious scholar. Iranian-US relations have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987-1988. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement. Following the elections of a reformist president and Majlis in the late 1990s, attempts to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction floundered as conservative politicians prevented reform measures from being enacted, increased repressive measures, and made electoral gains against reformers. Parliamentary elections in 2004 and the August 2005 inauguration of a conservative stalwart as president, completed the reconsolidation of conservative power in Iran's government.   	32	53	1648000	2440	9.78	76500	68688433	24.8	1.1	17	5.55	-0.48	1.05	1.05	1.04	0.96	1.04	40.3	40.49	40.1	70.26	68.86	71.74	1.8	0.1	31000	800	79.4	561600000000	181200000000	6.1	8300	23680000	30	25	45	40			13.5	48820000000	60400000000	28.9	3	142300000000	132100000000	840000000	600000000	3979000	1425000	2500000		79000000000	79000000000	3400000000	4920000000	55420000000	42500000000	19060000000	14571100	4300000	82	17000000	28	4610000	5246	100	7500000	321	129 	192 	15	7256	178152	4300000000	3.3	
Israel	is	Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords") guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May 2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it had occupied since 1982. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However, progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by Palestinian-Israeli violence between September 2000 and February 2005. An agreement reached at Sharm al-Sheikh in February 2005 significantly reduced the violence. The election in January 2005 of Mahmud ABBAS as the new Palestinian leader following the November 2004 death of Yasir ARAFAT, the formation of a Likud-Labor-United Torah Judaism coalition government in January 2005, and the successful Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip (August-September 2005), presented an opportunity for a renewed peace effort. However, internal Israeli political events between October and December 2005 have destabilized the political situation and forced early elections, scheduled for March 2006.   	31.5	34.75	 20770	273	15.45	1940	6352117	29.6	1.18	17.97	6.18		1.05	1.05	1.01	0.75	0.99	6.89	7.61	6.14	79.46	77.33	81.7	2.41	0.1	3000	100	95.4	154500000000	114300000000	5.2	24600	2420000				21	2.4	28.3	1.3	43820000000	58040000000	99.7	2.8	44240000000	39670000000	1470000000	0	2740	270100			200000000	200000000	0	0	40140000000	43190000000	75550000000	3000000	7222000	40	3070000	17	1690000	1069088	21	3200000	53	30 	23 	3	853	17364	9450000000	7.7	
Italy	it	Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north.   	42.8333333333333	12.8333333333333	 301230	7600	26.41	27500	58133509	42.2	0.04	8.72	10.4	2.06	1.07	1.06	1.02	0.72	0.96	5.83	6.42	5.19	79.81	76.88	82.94	1.28	0.5	140000	1000	98.6	1698000000000	1710000000000	0.1	29200	24490000	5	32	63		2.1	26.6	2	785700000000	861500000000	108.8	-1	270100000000	302200000000	500000000	51500000000	136200	1874000	456600	2158000	13550000000	76880000000	61000000	54780000000	371900000000	369200000000	922500000000	25957000	62750000	9	50500000	358	30300000	1246253	93	28870000	133	98 	35 	5	19459	479688	28000000	1.8	
Cote d'Ivoire	iv	Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African states, but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him to step aside and brought runner-up Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December 2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remain unresolved. The central government has yet to exert control over the northern regions and tensions remain high between GBAGBO and opposition leaders. Several thousand French and West African troops remain in Cote d'Ivoire to maintain peace and facilitate the disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation process.   	8	-5	 322460	515	10.23	730	17654843	19.2	2.03	35.11	14.84		1.03	0.97	1.02	0.95	1	89.11	105.73	71.99	48.82	46.24	51.48	4.5	7	570000	47000	50.9	28520000000	16570000000	1	1600	6950000				37	3.1	28.8	3.9	2434000000	2830000	64.5	15	5127000000	3418000000	1350000000	0	32900	20000			1300000000	1300000000	0	0	6490000000	4759000000	13430000000	238000	2190000	14	2260000	14	1090000	2015	5	300000	35	7 	28 		660	80000	246600000	1.6	
Iraq	iz	Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of military strongmen ruled the country, the latest was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. Coalition forces remain in Iraq, helping to restore degraded infrastructure and facilitating the establishment of a freely elected government, while simultaneously dealing with a robust insurgency. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which temporarily administered Iraq after the invasion, transferred full governmental authority on 28 June 2004, to the Iraqi Interim Government (IG), which governed under the Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq (TAL). Under the TAL, elections for a 275-member Transitional National Assembly (TNA) were held in Iraq on 30 January 2005. Following these elections, the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) assumed office. The TNA was charged with drafting Iraq's permanent constitution, which was approved in a 15 October 2005 constitutional referendum. An election under the constitution for a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) was held in December 2005. The CoR approval in the selection of most of the cabinet ministers on 20 May 2006 marked the transition from the ITG to Iraq's full-term government.   	33	44	 437072	58	13.12	35250	26783383	19.7	2.66	31.98	5.37		1.05	1.03	1.03	0.89	1.02	48.64	54.39	42.61	69.01	67.76	70.31	4.18	0.1	500		40.4	94100000000	46500000000	-3	3400	7400000							33	19300000000	24000000000			31700000000	33300000000	0	2020000000	2093000	351500	1420000		1500000000	1500000000	0	0	17780000000	19570000000	92330000000	1034200	574000	0	4850000	21	1750000	4	1	36000	110	77 	33 	8	2200	45550	1340000000		
Japan	ja	In 1603, a Tokugawa shogunate (military dictatorship) ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power. For 250 years this policy enabled Japan to enjoy stability and a flowering of its indigenous culture. Following the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854, Japan opened its ports and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an economic power and a staunch ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and business executives. The economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented growth, but Japan still remains a major economic power, both in Asia and globally. In 2005, Japan began a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.   	36	138	 377835	29751	11.64	25920	127463611	42.9	0.02	9.37	9.16		1.05	1.05	1.01	0.73	0.95	3.24	3.5	2.97	81.25	77.96	84.7	1.4	0.1	12000	500	99	4018000000000	4664000000000	2.7	31500	66400000	4.6	27.8	67.7		4.8	21.7	-0.3	1429000000000	1775000000	158	1.5	1017000000000	946300000000	0	0	120700	5578000	93360	5449000	2814000000	86510000000	0	77730000000	550500000000	451100000000	1545000000000	58788000	91473900	325	120500000	211	86500000	21304292	73	86300000	175	145 	30 	15	23556	1.183 million	44310000000	1

Jamaica	jm	The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated, replaced by African slaves. England siezed the island in 1655 and a plantation economy - based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee - was established. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of which became small farmers. Jamaica gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain, and in 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs created by the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. The cycle of violence, drugs, and poverty has served to impoverish large sectors of the populace. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy.   	18.25	-77.5	 10991	1022	15.83	250	2758124	23	0.8	20.82	6.52	-6.27	1.05	1.03	0.97	0.82	0.98	15.98	16.66	15.27	73.24	71.54	75.03	2.41	1.2	22000	900	87.9	12170000000	9127000000	1.5	4400	1200000	19.3	16.6	64.1	19.1	2.7	30.3	15.3	2800000000	3210000	128.7	-2	3717000000	2974000000	0	0	0	69000			0	0			1608000000	4093000000	7162000000	390700	2200000	23	1215000	7	460000	1271	21	1067000	35	11 	24 		272	18700	31170000	0.4	
Jan Mayen	jn	This desolate, mountainous island was named after a Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614 (earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by seal hunters and trappers over the following centuries, the island came under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant Haakon VII Toppen/Beerenberg volcano resumed activity in 1970; it is the northernmost active volcano on earth.   	71	-8	 377	124.1		0																																																								0					13		1		1 						
Jordan	jo	For most of its history since independence from British administration in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population, despite several wars and coup attempts. In 1989 he reinstituted parliamentary elections and gradual political liberalization; in 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in the European Free Trade Association in 2001. After a two-year delay, parliamentary and municipal elections took place in the summer of 2003. The prime minister appointed in December 2005 said the government would focus on political reforms, improving conditions for the poor, and fighting corruption.	31	36	 92300	26	3.32	750	5906760	23	2.49	21.25	2.65	6.26	1.06	1.04	1.15	0.95	1.1	16.76	20.04	13.28	78.4	75.9	81.05	2.63	0.1	600	500	91.3	26800000000	11510000000	6.1	4700	1460000	5	12.5	82.5	30	3.3	29.8	4.5	2800000000	4688000000	79.1	7.5	7517000000	7959000000	4000000	972000000	40	103000	0	100000	390000000	390000000	0	0	4226000000	8681000000	8528000000	617300	1594500	12	1660000	20	500000	2793	5	600000	17	15 	2 	1	505	7364	1400000000	11.4

Kenya	ke	Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition, defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform.   	1	38	 582650	536	8.01	1030	34707817	18.2	2.57	39.72	14.02		1.02	1.02	1.01	0.83	1.01	59.26	61.92	56.54	48.93	49.78	48.07	4.91	6.7	1200000	150000	85.1	37150000000	16110000000	5.2	1100	11850000	75	25	25	50	2	37.2	10.3	3715000000	3880000000	50.2	4.6	4342000000	4238000000	0	200000000	0	52000			0	0			3173000000	5126000000	7391000000	299300	2546200	48	3070000	8	730000	11645	65	1500000	225	15 	210 		2778	63000	280500000	1.6	
Kyrgyzstan	kg	A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864; it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAYEV, who had run the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIYEV. Current concerns include: privatization of state-owned enterprises, expansion of democracy and political freedoms, reduction of corruption, improving interethnic relations, and combating terrorism.   	41	75	 198500		6.55	10720	5213898	23.6	1.32	22.8	7.08	-2.5	1.05	1.04	0.96	0.64	0.96	34.49	39.72	28.98	68.49	64.48	72.7	2.69	0.1	3900	200	98.7	10650000000	2144000000	2	2100	2700000	55	15	30	40	3.9	23.3	5.2	516300000	539900000		7.1	13770000000	8783000000	4130000000	108000000	1990	11000			6000000	1500000000	0	1500000000	759000000	937400000	2428000000	416400	263400	28	520000		210000	18539		263000	37	18 	19 		470	18500	19200000	1.4	
North Korea	kn	An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula. Following World War II, Korea was split with the northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist domination. After failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il-so'ng, adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic "self-reliance" as a check against excessive Soviet or Communist Chinese influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM's son, the current ruler KIM Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in 1994. After decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied heavily on international aid to feed its population while continuing to expend resources to maintain an army of 1 million. North Korea's long-range missile development, as well as its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs and massive conventional armed forces, are of major concern to the international community. In December 2002, following revelations that the DPRK was pursuing a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium in violation of a 1994 agreement with the US to freeze and ultimately dismantle its existing plutonium-based program, North Korea expelled monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In January 2003, it declared its withdrawal from the international Non-Proliferation Treaty. In mid-2003 Pyongyang announced it had completed the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods (to extract weapons-grade plutonium) and was developing a "nuclear deterrent." Since August 2003, North Korea has participated in the Six-Party Talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US designed to resolve the stalemate over its nuclear programs. The fourth round of Six-Party Talks were held in Beijing during July-September 2005. All parties agreed to a Joint Statement of Principles in which, among other things, the six parties unanimously reaffirmed the goal of verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. In the Joint Statement, the DPRK committed to "abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards." The Joint Statement also commits the US and other parties to certain actions as the DPRK denuclearizes. The US offered a security assurance, specifying that it had no nuclear weapons on ROK territory and no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nuclear or other weapons. The US and DPRK will take steps to normalize relations, subject to the DPRK's implementing its denuclearization pledge and resolving other longstanding concerns. While the Joint Statement provides a vision of the end-point of the Six-Party process, much work lies ahead to implement the elements of the agreement.   	40	127	 120540	2495	22.4	14600	23113019	32	0.84	15.54	7.13		1.05	1.03	0.98	0.54	0.94	23.29	24.97	21.52	71.65	68.92	74.51	2.1				99			1	1700	9600000	36	64	64									18750000000	17430000000	0	0	0	25000		22000	0	0			1275000000		12000000000	980000		45	3360000	4	1200000		1		77	36 	41 	22	5214	31200	5000000000

South Korea	ks	Korea was an independent kingdom for much of the past millennium. Following its victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan occupied Korea; five years later it formally annexed the entire peninsula. After World War II, a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 14 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Yo'ng-sam became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. In June 2000, a historic first North-South summit took place between the South's President KIM Dae-jung and the North's leader KIM Jong Il.   	37	127.5	 98480	2413	16.58	8780	48846823	35.2	0.42	10	5.85		1.08	1.11	1.04	0.68	1.01	6.16	6.54	5.75	77.04	73.61	80.75	1.27	0.1	8300	200	97.9	965300000000	801200000000	3.9	20400	23530000	6.4	26.4	67.2	15	2.9	25	2.8	195000000000	189000000000	20	5.9	342100000000	321100000000	0	0	0	2061000	645200	2263000	0	24090000000	0	21110000000	288200000000	256000000000	153900000000	26595100	36586100	213	47500000	43	15900000	5433591	11	33900000	107	69 	38 	540	3472	97252	21060000000	2.6	
Christmas Island	kt	Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery, the island was annexed and settlement began by the UK in 1888. Phosphate mining began in the 1890s. The UK transferred sovereignty to Australia in 1958. Almost two-thirds of the island has been declared a national park.   	-10.5	105.666666666667	 135	138.9			1493		0																																																					3	1000	0	600	2193	2	464	1	1 				142			
Kuwait	ku	Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling Kuwaiti AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961. Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91.   	29.5	45.75	 17820	499	0.84	130	2418393	25.9	3.52	21.94	2.41	15.66	1.04	1.04	1.77	1.71	1.52	9.71	10.72	8.66	77.2	76.13	78.31	2.91	0.12			83.5	44770000000	52760000000	4.8	19200	1670000							4.1	47210000000	20770000000	12.1	13.1	38190000000	35520000000	0	0	2418000	305000	1970000		8300000000	8300000000	0	0	44430000000	12230000000	16120000000	497000	2000000	18	1175000	13	875000	2439	3	600000	7	4 	3 	5		4450	3010000000	4.2	
Kazakhstan	kz	Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 caused many of these newcomers to emigrate. Current issues include: developing a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets; achieving a sustainable economic growth outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors; and strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign powers.   	48	68	 2717300		8.28	35560	15233244	28.8	0.33	16	9.42	-3.33	1.06	1.04	0.96	0.55	0.93	28.3	32.88	23.45	66.89	61.56	72.52	1.89	0.2	16500	200	98.4	124300000000	47390000000	9.2	8200	7850000	20	30	50	19	3.3	26.5	7.6	12190000000	12440000000	10.5	4.6	60330000000	52550000000	6000000000	2450000000	1300000	221000	890000	47000	18500000000	15200000000	4100000000		30090000000	17510000000	41660000000	2500000	2758900	86	6470000	12	3880000	20327	10	400000	150	67 	83 	4	13700	258029	221800000	0.9	
Laos	la	Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM. For three hundred years Lan Xang included large parts of present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the control of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1986. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997.   	18	105	 236800		4.01	1750	6368481	18.9	2.39	35.49	11.55		1.04	1.01	0.98	0.81	0.98	83.31	92.95	73.26	55.49	53.45	57.61	4.68	0.1	1700	200	66.4	12130000000	2523000000	7.2	1900	2800000	80	20	20	34	3.2	30.6	7	319300000	434600000		13	3767000000	3298000000	435000000	230000000	0	2950			0	0				541000000	2490000000	90067	520546	22	730000	7	52000	1152	1	20900	44	9 	35 			32620	11040000	0.4	
Lebanon	le	Following the capture of Syria from the Ottoman Empire by Anglo-French forces in 1918, France received a mandate over this territory and separated it from Lebanon. France granted complete independence in 1946. A 15-year civil war (1976-1991) devastated the country, but Lebanon has since made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater voice in the political process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war, Lebanon has conducted several successful elections, most militias have been disbanded, and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have extended authority over about two-thirds of the country. Hizballah, a radical Shi'a organization listed by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, retains its weapons. During Lebanon's civil war, the Arab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's troop deployment, numbering about 16,000 based mainly east of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley. Damascus justified its continued military presence in Lebanon by citing Beirut's requests and the failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if Accord. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000, however, encouraged some Lebanese groups to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well. The passage of UNSCR 1559 in early October 2004 - a resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its interference in Lebanese affairs - further emboldened Lebanese groups opposed to Syria's presence in Lebanon. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq HARIRI and 20 others in February 2005 led to massive demonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence ("the Cedar Revolution"). Syria finally withdrew the remainder of its military forces from Lebanon in April 2005. In May-June 2005, Lebanon held its first legislative elections since the end of the civil war free of foreign interference, handing a two-thirds majority to the bloc led by Saad HARIRI, the slain prime minister's son.   	33.8333333333333	35.8333333333333	 10400	225	16.35	1040	3874050	27.8	1.23	18.52	6.21		1.05	1.04	0.92	0.83	0.94	23.72	26.34	20.97	72.88	70.41	75.48	1.9	0.1	2800	200	87.4	23690000000	20700000000	0.5	6200	2600000				28			2.4	4953000000	6595000000	180.5		10670000000	10670000000	0	750000000	0	102000			0	0			1782000000	8855000000	26000000000	630000	888000	46	2850000	15	1180000	3365	22	600000	7	5 	2 		401	7300	540600000	3.1	
Latvia	lg	After a brief period of independence between the two World Wars, Latvia was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It reestablished its independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.   	57	25	 64589	531	28.19	200	2274735	39.4	-0.67	9.24	13.66	-2.26	1.05	1.05	0.94	0.48	0.86	9.35	11.31	7.29	71.33	66.08	76.85	1.27	0.6	7600	500	99.8	30290000000	14430000000	10.2	13200	1110000	15	25	60		2.9	25.9	6.7	5646000000	5889000000	10.9	8.5	3573000000	5839000000	300000000	2816000000	0	29000			NA	1800000000	0	1700000000	5749000000	8559000000	13960000000	650500	1536700	65	1760000	44	1220000	53251	41	810000	46	24 	22 		2303	69919	87000000	1.2	
Lithuania	lh	Independent between the two World Wars, Lithuania was annexed by the USSR in 1940. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.   	56	24	 65200	90	44.81	70	3585906	38.2	-0.3	8.75	10.98	-0.71	1.06	1.05	0.96	0.52	0.89	6.78	8.12	5.37	74.2	69.2	79.49	1.2	0.1	1300	200	99.6	49210000000	23500000000	7.5	13700	1610000	20	30	50		3.1	25.6	2.7	8429000000	9103000000	18.7	7.3	18640000000	9109000000	12370000000	4144000000	12360	89000			0	3030000000	0	2760000000	10950000000	13330000000	12500000000	820000	3421500	172	1900000	27 	1700000	136346	32	968000	91	34 	57 		1771	79497	230800000	1.9	
Liberia	li	In August 2003, a comprehensive peace agreement ended 14 years of civil war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who was exiled to Nigeria. After two years of rule by a transitional government, democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON-SIRLEAF to power. The legislative and presidential polls were broadly deemed free and fair despite fraud allegations from JOHNSON-SIRLEAF's rival George WEAH. The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), which maintains a strong presence throughout the country, completed a disarmament program for former combatants in late 2004, but the security situation is still volatile and the process of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this war-torn country remains sluggish.   	6.5	-9.5	 111370	579	3.43	30	3042004	18.1	4.91	44.77	23.1	27.39	1.03	1	0.98	0.94	0.99	155.76	171.96	139.06	39.65	37.99	41.35	6.02	5.9	100000	7200	57.5	2755000000		8	1000		70	8	22	80			15	85400000	90500000			509400000	473800000	0	0	0	3400			0	0			910000000	4839000000	3200000000	6900	47300	9	790000	1	70000	5	2	1000	53	2 	51 		490	10600	67400000	7.5	
Slovakia	lo	The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I allowed the Slovaks to join the closely related Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II, Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-ruled Eastern Europe. Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.   	48.6666666666667	19.5	 48845		29.23	1830	5439448	35.8	0.15	10.65	9.45	0.3	1.05	1.05	0.99	0.6	0.94	7.26	8.48	5.98	74.73	70.76	78.89	1.33	0.1	200	100	99.6	87320000000	43070000000	5.5	16100	2240000					5.1	18.2	2.7	22700000000	23200000000	36.9	3.7	30570000000	24800000000	10590000000	8731000000	3808	71400			165000000	6720000000	1000000	6949000000	32390000000	34480000000	26940000000	1250400	4275200	95	3120000	6	2620000	135991	6	2276000	36	18 	18 	1	3662	42993	406000000	1.87

Liechtenstein	ls	The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719; it became a sovereign state in 1806. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. Shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight have resulted in concerns about the use of the financial institutions for money laundering. Liechtenstein has, however, implemented new anti-money-laundering legislation and recently concluded a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US.   	47.2666666666667	9.53333333333333	 160		25		33987	39.6	0.78	10.21	7.18	4.77	1.01	0.98	0.99	0.73	0.95	4.64	6.24	3.04	79.68	76.1	83.28	1.51				100	1786000000		11	25000	29500	2	47	51				1	424200000	414100000																	0	19900	11400	4	21000		12000	7491	44	20000						250			
Lesotho	lt	Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and reinstated in 1995. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after 7 years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswanan military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Constitutional reforms have since restored political stability; peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002.   	-29.5	28.5	 30355		10.87	30	2022331	20.3	-0.46	24.75	28.71	-0.68	1.03	1.01	0.94	0.66	0.95	87.24	92.04	82.28	34.4	35.55	33.21	3.28	28.9	320000	29000	84.8	5124000000	1362000000	0.8	2500	838000		14	14	49	0.9	43.4	4.7	738500000	792100000		15.5	350000000	363500000	0	38000000	0	1400			0	0			602800000	1166000000	735000000	37200	159000	4		1		154	1	43000	28	3 	25 			5940	41100000	2.1	
Luxembourg	lu	Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half of its territory to Belgium in 1839, but gained a larger measure of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.   	49.75	6.16666666666667	 2586		23.94		474413	38.7	1.23	11.94	8.41	8.75	1.07	1.06	1.02	0.68	0.97	4.74	4.73	4.76	78.89	75.6	82.38	1.78	0.2	500	100	100	30740000000	31760000000	3.7	55600	316500	1	13	86				2.5	9195000000	9573000		4.5	3203000000	6140000000	2346000000	5287000000	0	55700	634	50700	0	1205000000	0	867000000	13390000000			360100	539000	13	285000	5	285000	70465	8	270800	2	1 	1 	1	274	5210	231600000	0.9	
Libya	ly	From the earliest days of his rule following the 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI has espoused his own political system, the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of "direct democracy." QADHAFI has always seen himself as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libyan support for terrorism appeared to have decreased after the imposition of sanctions. During the 1990s, QADHAFI also began to rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya resolved the Lockerbie case. In December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, and QADHAFI has made significant strides in normalizing relations with western nations since then. He has received various Western European leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations, and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004. QADHAFI also finally resolved in 2004 several outstanding cases against his government for terrorist activities in the 1980s by compensating the families of victims of the UTA and La Belle disco bombings.   	25	17	 1759540	1770	1.03	4700	5900754	23	2.3	26.49	3.48		1.05	1.04	1.06	0.96	1.05	23.71	25.99	21.32	76.69	74.46	79.02	3.28	0.3	10000		82.6	65790000000	31490000000	8.5	11400	1640000	17	23	59				3.4	25340000000	15470000000	8.2		14400000000	13390000000	0	0	1643000	237000			7000000000	6250000000	770000000	0	30790000000	10820000000	4267000000	750000	127000	22	1350000	12	730000	47	1	205000	141	60 	81 	2	2757	83200	1300000000	3.9	
Madagascar	ma	Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony in 1896, but regained its independence in 1960. During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held, ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner.   	-20	47	 587040	4828	5.03	10860	18595469	17.5	3.03	41.41	11.11		1.03	1	0.98	0.82	0.99	75.21	83.34	66.84	57.34	54.93	59.82	5.62	1.7	140000	7500	68.9	16360000000	4719000000	5.1	900	7300000				50	3	29	15	703600000	853000000		3	825400000	767700000	0	0	89.27	15000			0	0			951000000	1400000000	4600000000	58700	333900	17	3050000	1	325000	805	2	90000	116	29 	87 		854	49827	329000000	7.2	
Martinique	mb	The French began to settle this island in 1635, overcoming resistance from the local Carib inhabitants. In 1660, the suviving natives were rounded up and permanently expelled. The island has subsequently remained a French possession except for three brief periods of foreign occupation.   	14.6666666666667	-61	 1100	350	9.09	70	436131	34.1	0.72	13.74	6.48	-0.03	1.02	1.03	1	0.82	0.99	6.95	4.68	9.27	79.18	79.5	78.85	1.79				97.7	6117000000			14400	165900	10	17	73				3.9	317500000	317500000			1205000000	1120000000	0	0	0	13800			0	0			404200000		180000000	172000	319900	14	82000	11	66000	70	2	107000	2	1 	1 			2105			
Macau	mc	Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 20 December 1999. China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system will not be practiced in Macau, and that Macau will enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.   	22.1666666666667	113.55	 28.2	41			453125	36.1	0.86	8.48	4.47	4.56	1.05	1.07	0.91	0.72	0.92	4.35	4.54	4.15	82.19	79.36	85.17	1.02				94.5	10000000000	10050000000	2.8	22000	251200							3.8	3160000000	3160000000			1893000000	1899000000	0	153300000	0	12000			0	0			3465000000		3100000000	174389	532758	2	160000	1	49000	62	1	201000	1	1 				368			
Moldova	md	Formerly part of Romania, Moldova was incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although independent from the USSR since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population, mostly Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed a "Transnistria" republic. The poorest nation in Europe, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a Communist as its president in 2001.   	47	29	 33843		54.52	3000	4466706	32.3	0.28	15.7	12.64	-0.23	1.05	1.04	0.93	0.59	0.91	38.38	41.44	35.17	65.65	61.61	69.88	1.85	0.2	5500	300	99.1	8175000000	2416000000	7.1	1800	1340000	40	14	46	80	2.2	30.7	11.9	1069000000	1065000000	79.6	17	2942000000	3036000000	300000000	600000000	0	37000			0	2380000000	0	2050000000	1040000000	2230000000	1986000000	863400	787000	60	3220000	1	1260000	30861	2	406000	12	6 	6 		1138	12730	8700000	0.4

Mongolia	mg	The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAN they conquered a huge Eurasian empire. After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and later came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing. A Communist regime was installed in 1924. The ex-Communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992, but was defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996 parliamentary election. Since then, parliamentary elections returned the MPRP overwhelmingly to power in 2000 and produced a coalition government in 2004.   	46	105	 1564116		0.76	840	2832224	24.6	1.46	21.59	6.95		1.05	1.04	1	0.77	1	52.12	55.51	48.57	64.89	62.64	67.25	2.25	0.1	500	200	97.8	5242000000	1400000000	6.2	1900	1488000				36.1	2.1	37	9.5	702000000	651000000		4.1	3240000000	3370000000	18000000	130000000	548.8	11220	515	11210	0	0			852000000		1360000000	142300	404400	72	155900	52	168800	192	5	200000	44	12 	32 	2	1810	49250	23100000	2.2	
Montserrat	mh	English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three decades later. The British and French fought for possesion of the island for most of the 18th century, but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783. The island's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century. Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995. Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since, with the last eruption occurring in July 2003.   	16.75	-62.2	 102	40	20		9439	28.9	1.05	17.59	7.1		1.05	1.04	0.91	1.06	0.96	7.19	8.35	5.97	78.85	76.67	81.14	1.77				97	29000000		-1	3400	4521 							2.6	31400000	31600000			2000000	1860000	0	0	0	380			0	0					8900000		70	3	7000	1	3000	363	17		2	2 				227			
Malawi	mi	Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution which came into full effect the following year. Current President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term, has struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor, who still leads their shared political party. MUTHARIKA's anti-corruption efforts have led to several high-level arrests and one prominent conviction. Increasing corruption, population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, and the spread of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for the country.   	-13.5	34	 118480		20.68	560	13013926	16.5	2.38	43.13	19.33		1.03	1.02	0.98	0.68	0.99	94.37	98.66	89.96	41.7	41.93	41.45	5.92	14.2	900000	84000	62.7	7524000000	1984000000	-3	600	4500000	90	10	10	55			15.4	844600000	913900000	195.9	7.9	1296000000	1206000000	0	0	0	5450			0	0			364000000	645000000	3287000000	93000	222100	16	2600000	1		305	3	46100	42	6 	36 		797	28400	15810000	0.8	
Montenegro	mj	The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta; over subsequent centuries it was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th centuries, Montenegro became a theocratic state ruled by a series of bishop princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality. After World War I, Montenegro was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and, at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro. Following a three-year postponement, Montenegro held an independence referendum in the spring of 2006 under rules set by the EU. The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded the 55% threshold, allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006.   	42.5	19.3	 14026	293.5	13.7		630548		3.5	12.6	9.2																		2412000000	1125000000		3800	259100	2	30	68	12.2			3.4					2864000000															177663	543220	0		13				50000	5	3 	2 	NA	250	7353			
Macedonia	mk	Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1991, but Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." In 1995, Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations, although differences over Macedonia's name remain. The undetermined status of neighboring Kosovo, implementation of the Framework Agreement - which ended the 2001 ethnic Albanian armed insurgency - and a weak economy continue to be challenges for Macedonia.   	41.8333333333333	22	 25333		22.01	550	2050554	34.1	0.26	12.02	8.77	-0.65	1.08	1.07	1.02	0.78	1	9.81	9.94	9.66	73.97	71.51	76.62	1.57	0.1	200	100	96.1		5304000000	3.7	7800	855000				29.6			0	2105000000	2150000	33.7	6.8	6271000000	7933000000	0	1662000000	0	23000			0	0			2047000000	3196000000	2190000000	525000	830000	49	410000	31	510000	3541	6	392671	17	10 	7 		699	8684	200000000	6	
Mali	ml	The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a coup that ushered in democratic government. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first democratic presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, KONARE stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE.   	17	-4	1240000		3.76	2360	11716829	15.8	2.63	49.82	16.89	-6.6	1.03	1.03	0.96	0.7	0.98	107.58	117.32	97.54	49	47.05	51.01	7.42	1.9	140000	12000	46.4	13560000000	5434000000	6	1200	3930000	80	20	20	64	1.8	40.4	4.5	764000000	828000000			820000000	762600000	0	0	0	4250			0	0			323000000	1858000000	2800000000	74900	400000	0	570000	1	45000	270	13	50000	29	9 	20 		729	15100	106300000	1.9

Morocco	mo	In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Morocco virtually annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature, which first met in 1997. Parliamentary elections were held for the second time in September 2002 and municipal elections were held in September 2003.   	32	-5	 446550	1835	19	14450	33241259	23.9	1.55	21.98	5.58	-0.87	1.05	1.04	0.99	0.77	0.99	40.24	43.99	36.3	70.94	68.62	73.37	2.68	0.1	15000		51.7	138300000000	51940000000	1.8	4200	11190000	40	15	45	19	2.6	30.9	1	12940000000	16770000000	72		17350000000	17580000000	0	1450000000	300	158000			5000000	650000000			9472000000	18150000000	15610000000	1308600	9336900	58	6640000	35	3100000	2538	8	3500000	60	26 	34 	1	1907	57694	2310000000	5	
Mauritius	mp	Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in 1505; it was subsequently held by the Dutch, French, and British before independence was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather and declining sugar prices have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community.   	-20.2833333333333	57.55	 2040	177	49.02	220	1240827	30.8	0.82	15.43	6.86	-0.4	1.02	1.01	1	0.64	0.97	14.59	17.23	11.9	72.63	68.66	76.66	1.95	0.1	700	100	85.6	16090000000	6681000000	3	13100	570000				10			5	1377000000	1770000000	67.5	8	1941000000	1805000000	0	0	0	21000			0	0			1949000000	2507000000	3246000000	353800	510000	13	420000	2	258000	4954	2	180000	6	2 	4 			2254	12040000	0.2

Mauritania	mr	Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976, but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984. Opposition parties were legalized and a new constitution approved in 1991. Two multiparty presidential elections since then were widely seen as flawed, but October 2001 legislative and municipal elections were generally free and open. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council headed by Col. Ely Ould Mohamed VALL, which declared it would remain in power for up to two years while it created conditions for genuine democratic institutions and organized elections. For now, however, Mauritania remains an autocratic state, and the country continues to experience ethnic tensions among its black population and different Moor (Arab-Berber) communities.   	20	-12	 1030700	754	0.2	490	3177388	17	2.88	40.99	12.16		1.03	1.01	0.97	0.67	0.98	69.48	72.44	66.43	53.12	50.88	55.42	5.86	0.6	9500	500	41.7	6891000000	1346000000	5.5	2200	786000	50	10	40	40	2.5	30.2	7	421000000	378000000		2	185600000	172600000	0	0	0	24000			0	0			784000000	1124000000	2500000000	39000	522400	16	410000	1	98000	21	5	14000	25	8 	17 		717	7660	19320000	1.4	
Malta	mt	Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814. The island staunchly supported the UK through both World Wars and remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU member in May 2004.   	35.8333333333333	14.5833333333333	 316	196.8	31.25	20	400214	38.7	0.42	10.22	8.1	2.05	1.06	1.06	1.02	0.75	0.99	3.86	4.34	3.35	79.01	76.83	81.31	1.5	0.2	500	100	92.8	7926000000	5193000000	1	19900	160000	3	22	75				3	2503000000	2703000000			2082000000	1936000000	0	0	0	18000			0	0			2744000000	3859000000	188800000	206500	306100	25	255000	6	280000	10739	6	301000	1	1 				2254	38168000	1	
Oman	mu	In 1970, QABOOS bin Said al-Said ousted his father and has ruled as sultan ever since. His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world and has preserved a longstanding political and military relationship with the UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries.   	21	57	 212460	2092	0.12	720	3102229	19	3.28	36.24	3.81	0.35	1.05	1.04	1.44	1.23	1.25	18.89	21.65	16	73.37	71.14	75.72	5.77	0.1	1300	200	75.8	39650000000	24980000000	4.3	13200	920000							1.2	14360000000	10610000000	8.1	4.1	10300000000	9582000000	0	0	769000	62000	721000		16500000000	7090000000	7430000000	0	19010000000	8709000000	4361000000	242700	805000	14	1400000	13	1600000	3261	1	245000	137	6 	131 	1		34965	252990000	11.4	
Maldives	mv	The Maldives was long a sultanate, first under Dutch and then under British protection. It became a republic in 1968, three years after independence. Since 1978, President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM - currently in his sixth term in office - has dominated the islands' political scene. Following riots in the capital Male in August 2004, the president and his government have pledged to embark upon democratic reforms, including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms. Tourism and fishing are being developed on the archipelago.   	3.25	73	 300	644	13.33		359008	17.9	2.78	34.81	7.06		1.05	1.06	1.04	0.98	1.05	54.89	54.01	55.8	64.41	63.08	65.8	4.9	0.1	100		97.2	1250000000		-5.5	3900	88000	22	18	60				5.6	265000000	362000000		-0.9	135000000	125600000	0	0	0	4000			0	0			123000000	567000000	316000000	31500	113200	3	35000	1	10000	1343	1	19000	5	2 	3 				45070000	5.5	
Mexico	mx	The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in over half a century. The nation continues to make an impressive recovery. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the impoverished southern states. Elections held in July 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that the opposition defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) was sworn in on 1 December 2000 as the first chief executive elected in free and fair elections.   	23	-102	 1972550	9330	12.66	63200	107449525	25.3	1.16	20.69	4.74	-4.32	1.05	1.04	0.94	0.83	0.96	20.26	22.19	18.24	75.41	72.63	78.33	2.42	0.3	160000	5000	92.2	1067000000000	693000000000	3	10000	43400000	18	24	58	40	1.6	35.6	4	181000000000	184000000000	17.4	1.9	209200000000	193900000000	1070000000	390200000	3420000	1752000	1863000	205000	47300000000	55100000000	0	7850000000	213700000000	223700000000	137200000000	18073200	38451100	1410	31000000	236	25600000	2026633	51	16995400	1839	228 	1,611 	1	17562	349038	6070000000	0.8	
Malaysia	my	During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the country's history were marred by Indonesian efforts to control Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965.   	2.5	112.5	 329750	4675	5.46	3650	24385858	24.1	1.78	22.86	5.05		1.07	1.06	1.01	0.79	1.01	17.16	19.87	14.25	72.5	69.8	75.38	3.04	0.4	52000	2000	88.7	290200000000	122000000000	5.3	12100	10670000	14.5	36	49.5	8	1.4	39.2	3	30570000000	34620000000	46.2	4.1	79280000000	73630000000	100000000	0	770000	510000	230200		53500000000	28530000000	22410000000	0	147100000000	118700000000	52000000000	4446300	14611900	441	10900000	51	10800000	151239	7	10040000	117	37 	80 	2	1890	71814	1690000000	2.03	
Mozambique	mz	Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration by whites, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His newly elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, has promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment.   	-18.25	35	 801590	2470	5.43	1180	19686505	18.3	1.38	35.18	21.35		1.03	1.01	0.94	0.72	0.97	129.24	134.31	124.02	39.82	39.53	40.13	4.62	12.2	1300000	110000	47.8	26030000000	5727000000	7	1300	9200000	81	6	13	70	2.5	31.7	6.5	1031000000	1930000000		3.4	15140000000	10460000000	9500000000	5875000000	0	11000			60000000	60000000	0	0	1690000000	2041000000	5456000000	77600	708000	41	730000	1	67600	7228	11	138000	158	22 	136 		3123	30400	78030000	1.3	
New Caledonia	nc	Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century, the island was made a French possession in 1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord, which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to conduct as many as three referenda between 2013 and 2018, to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.   	-21.5	165.5	 19060	2254	0.32	100	219246	27.8	1.24	18.11	5.69		1.05	1.04	1.01	0.87	1.01	7.57	8.27	6.83	74.27	71.29	77.39	2.28				91	3158000000			15000	78990	20	20	60				-0.6	856300000	836500000		-0.6	1581000000	1470000000	0	0	0	10000			0	0			999000000	1636000000	79000000	53300	116400	6	107000	6	52000	6764	1	70000	25	11 	14 	6		5432			
Niue	ne	Niue's remoteness, as well as cultural and linguistic differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest of the Cook Islands, have caused it to be separately administered. The population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5,200 in 1966 to about 2,166 in 2006), with substantial emigration to New Zealand, 2,400 km to the southwest.   	-19.0333333333333	-169.866666666667	 260	64	11.54		2166		0.01																			95	7600000		-0.3	3600								1					3000000	2790000	0	0	0	20			0	0					418,000	1100	400	2	1000	1			1	900	1	1 				234

Niger	ng	Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999 BARE was killed in a coup by military officers who promptly restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa.   	16	8	1267000		11.43	730	12525094	16.5	2.92	50.73	20.91	-0.61	1.03	1.04	1.06	0.99	1.05	118.25	122.29	114.1	43.76	43.8	43.73	7.46	1.2	70000	4800	17.6	11280000000	3432000000	4.5	900	70000	90	6	4	63	0.8	35.4	0.2	320000000	320000000		5.1	230000000	263900000	0	50000000	0	5400			0	0			222000000	588000000	2100000000	24100	148300	15	680000	3	125000	137	1	24000	28	9 	19 			10100	44780000	1.4

Nigeria	ni	Following nearly 16 years of military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The president faces the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In addition, the OBASANJO administration must defuse longstanding ethnic and religious tensions, if it is to build a sound foundation for economic growth and political stability. Although the April 2003 elections were marred by some irregularities, Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence.   	10	8	 923768	853	33.02	2820	131859731	18.7	2.38	40.43	16.94	0.27	1.03	1.02	1.04	0.91	1.02	97.14	104.05	90.02	47.08	46.52	47.66	5.49	5.4	3600000	310000	68	174100000000	77330000000	6.2	1400	57210000	70	10	20	60	1.6	40.8	13.5	12860000000	13540000000	11	3.8	15590000000	14460000000	40000000	0	2451000	310000			19200000000	7410000000	7830000000	0	52160000000	25950000000	32450000000	1395786	21571131	130	23500000	3	6900000	1535	11	1769700	69	36 	33 	1	3505	194394	737600000	0.8

Norway	no	Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current focus is on containing spending on the extensive welfare system and planning for the time when petroleum reserves are depleted. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.   	62	10	 323802	25148	2.7	1270	4610820	38.4	0.38	11.46	9.4	1.73	1.05	1.05	1.03	0.73	0.98	3.67	4.03	3.29	79.54	76.91	82.31	1.78	0.1	2100	100	100	194100000000	246900000000	3.9	42300	2400000	4	22	74		4.1	21.8	1.6	176100000000	131300000000	50.1	-0.5	105600000000	106100000000	5600000000	13500000000	3220000	257200	3466000	88870	73400000000	4140000000	50500000000	0	111200000000	58120000000	281000000000	2228000	4163400	6	4030000	360	2030000	1342667	13	3140000	99	67 	32 	1	4077	91916	4033500000	1.9	
Nepal	np	In 1951, the Nepalese monarch ended the century-old system of rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. A Maoist insurgency, launched in 1996, has gained traction and is threatening to bring down the regime, especially after a negotiated cease-fire between the Maoists and government forces broke down in August 2003. In 2001, the crown prince massacred ten members of the royal family, including the king and queen, and then took his own life. In October 2002, the new king dismissed the prime minister and his cabinet for "incompetence" after they dissolved the parliament and were subsequently unable to hold elections because of the ongoing insurgency. While stopping short of reestablishing parliament, the king in June 2004 reinstated the most recently elected prime minister who formed a four-party coalition government. Citing dissatisfaction with the government's lack of progress in addressing the Maoist insurgency and corruption, the king in February 2005 dissolved the government, declared a state of emergency, imprisoned party leaders, and assumed power. The king's government subsequently released party leaders and officially ended the state of emergency in May 2005, but the monarch retained absolute power until April 2006. After nearly three months of mass protests organized by the seven-party opposition and the Maoists, the king allowed parliament to reconvene on 28 April 2006.   	28	84	 147181		16.07	11700	28287147	20.3	2.17	30.98	9.31		1.05	1.07	1.06	0.95	1.06	65.32	63.56	67.17	60.18	60.43	59.91	4.1	0.5	61000	3100	48.6	39900000000	6655000000	2.7	1400	10400000	76	6	18	31	2.6	39.1	7.8	1153000000	1789000000		3.8	2565000000	1850000000	111000000	241000000	0	11980			0	0			822000000	2000000000	3340000000	417900	116800	12	840000	1	130000	7846	6	175000	48	10 	38 		59	15905	104900000	1.5

Suriname	ns	First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to rule through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian government, but a democratically elected government returned to power in 1991.   	4	-56	 163270	386	0.36	510	439117	26.5	0.2	18.02	7.27	-8.76	1.05	1.05	1.06	0.79	1.04	23.02	26.89	18.95	69.01	66.66	71.47	2.32	1.7	5200	500	88	2818000000	1300000000	2	4100	156700	8	14	78	70			9.5	392600000	425900000		6.5	2014000000	1873000000	0	0	12000	14000	1370	1644	0	0			881000000	750000000	504300000	81300	212800	18	300000	3	63000	122	2	30000	47	5 	42 			4492	7500000	0.7	
Netherlands Antilles	nt	Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, the island of Curacao was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of oil refineries to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. The island of Saint Martin is shared with France; its southern portion is named Sint Maarten and is part of the Netherlands Antilles; its northern portion is called Saint-Martin and is part of Guadeloupe (France).   	12.25	-68.75	 960	364	10		221736	32.8	0.79	14.78	6.45	-0.4	1.05	1.05	0.92	0.7	0.93	9.76	10.54	8.93	76.03	73.76	78.41	1.99				96.7	2800000000		1	16000	83600	1	20	79				2.1	757900000	949500000			1017000000	945800000	0	0	0	72500			0	0			2076000000	4383000000	2680000000	81000	200000	27	217000	3	69000	1385		2000	5	5 							
Nicaragua	nu	The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990, 1996, and again in 2001, saw the Sandinistas defeated. The country has slowly rebuilt its economy during the 1990s, but was hard hit by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.   	13	-85	 129494	910	14.81	610	5570129	20.9	1.89	24.51	4.45	-1.17	1.05	1.04	0.99	0.78	1	28.11	31.51	24.54	70.63	68.55	72.81	2.75	0.2	6400	500	67.5	16090000000	5030000000	4	2900	2010000	30.5	17.3	52.2	50	1.2	45	9.6	1134000000	1358000000	82.3	2.4	2887000000	1848000000	21800000	23300000	14300	25200	758.9	15560	0	0			1550000000	2865000000	3188000000	214500	738600	96	1240000	3	320000	12628	3	125000	176	11 	165 		6	19036	32270000	0.7	
New Zealand	nz	The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D. 800. In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. In that same year, the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both World Wars. New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances.   	-41	174	 268680	15134	5.54	2850	4076140	33.9	0.99	13.76	7.53	3.63	1.04	1.05	1.01	0.78	0.99	5.76	6.59	4.89	78.81	75.82	81.93	1.79	0.1	1400	200	99	101800000000	94600000000	2.2	25200	2130000	10	25	65				3	43100000000	37570000000	21.3	-2.5	39820000000	37030000000	0	0	31740	151900	30220	119700	4773000000	4773000000	0	0			42840000000	1800500	3027000	418	3750000	41	1926000	751719	36	3200000	118	45 	73 		4128	92662	1147000000	1	
Southern Ocean		A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons, but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients, which promotes marine plant life, and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life. In the spring of 2000, the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, but larger than the Arctic Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary oceans by the US Government.   	-60	90	20327000	17968																																																																									
Paraguay	pa	In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70), Paraguay lost two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory. It stagnated economically for the next half century. In the Chaco War of 1932-35, large, economically important areas were won from Bolivia. The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER was overthrown in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in political infighting in recent years, relatively free and regular presidential elections have been held since then.   	-23	-58	 406750		7.47	670	6506464	21.3	2.45	29.1	4.49	-0.08	1.05	1.03	1.01	0.86	1.01	24.78	29.4	19.92	75.1	72.56	77.78	3.89	0.5	15000	600	94	29080000000	7281000000	2.7	4900	2680000	45			32	0.5	43.8	6.8	1334000000	1370000	36	0	51290000000	3528000000	44170000000	0	0	25000			0	0			3130000000	3832000000	3450000000	280800	1770300	79	925000	5	990000	10206	4	150000	881	12 	869 		36	29500	53100000	0.9	
Pitcairn Islands	pc	Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the British and settled in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions. Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become a British colony (in 1838) and today remains the last vestige of that empire in the South Pacific. Outmigration, primarily to New Zealand, has thinned the population from a peak of 233 in 1937 to less than 50 today.   	-25.0666666666667	-130.1	 47	51			45		-0.01																								15								746,000 	1028000																		1		1				5								6			
Peru	pe	Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime. FUJIMORI won reelection to a third term in the spring of 2000, but international pressure and corruption scandals led to his ouster by Congress in November of that year. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO as the new head of government; his presidency has been hampered by allegations of corruption.   	-10	-76	 1285220	2414	2.88	12000	28302603	25.3	1.32	20.48	6.23	-1.01	1.05	1.04	1.01	0.89	1.01	30.94	33.49	28.27	69.84	68.05	71.71	2.51	0.5	82000	4200	87.7	164500000000	69810000000	6.7	5900	9060000	9	18	73	54	0.8	37.2	1.6	21870000000	22470000000	38	6.9	22680000000	21090000000	0	0	120000	157000	49000		560000000	910000000	0	0	15950000000	12150000000	30940000000	2049800	4092600	859	6650000	13	3060000	205532	10	4570000	268	54 	214 	1	3462	78672	829300000	1.4	
Paracel Islands		The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. The islands are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.   	16.5	112	 NA	518		0																																																															1	1

Pakistan	pk	The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with two sections West and East) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan conducted its own tests in 1998. The dispute over the state of Kashmir is ongoing, but discussions and confidence-building measures have led to decreased tensions since 2002.   	30	70	 803940	1046	24.44	182300	165803560	19.8	2.09	29.74	8.23	-0.59	1.05	1.06	1.05	0.92	1.05	70.45	70.84	70.04	63.39	62.4	64.44	4	0.1	74000	4900	48.7	393400000000	89550000000	6.9	2400	46840000	42	20	38	32	4.1	27.6	9.1	15450000000	20070000000	53.8	10.7	76920000000	71540000000	0	0	63000	365000			23800000000	23800000000	0	0	14850000000	21260000000	38800000000	4502200	5022900	49	13500000	22	3100000	38309	30	7500000	139	91 	48 	18	8163	254410	4260000000	3.9	
Poland	pl	Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th century. During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland amongst themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union "Solidarity" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A "shock therapy" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment, underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure, and a poor rural underclass. Solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of Parliament, and the new leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce the Trade Union's political role. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.   	52	20	 312685	491	40.25	1000	38536869	37	-0.05	9.85	9.89	-0.46	1.06	1.06	0.99	0.62	0.94	7.22	7.95	6.44	74.97	70.95	79.23	1.25	0.1	14000	100	99.8	514000000000	246200000000	3.2	13300	17100000	16.1	29	54.9	17	3.1	26.7	2.2	52730000000	63220000000	47.7	3.7	150800000000	121300000000	15200000000	5000000000	24530	476200	53000	413700	4330000000	14970000000	44000000	9450000000	92720000000	95670000000	101500000000	12458000	29260000	792	20200000	40	13050000	366898	19	10600000	122	83 	39 	3	23072	423997	3500000000	1.71	
Panama	pm	With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. On 7 September 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of 1999. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the intervening years. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were turned over to Panama by or on 31 December 1999.   	9	-80	 78200	2490	7.26	430	3191319	26.1	1.6	21.74	5.36	-0.4	1.05	1.04	1.03	0.88	1.02	16.37	17.75	14.92	75.22	72.68	77.87	2.68	0.9	16000	500	92.6	22760000000	14890000000	6.4	7200	1390000	20.8	18	61.2	37	1.2	35.7	2.9	3426000000	3959000	64.9	1.7	5398000000	4870000000	175000000	25000000	0	78000			0	0			7481000000	8734000000	9758000000	376100	855900	235	815000	38	510000	7013	6	300000	117	53 	64 		355	11643	150000000	1	
Portugal	po	Following its heyday as a world power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence in 1822 of Brazil as a colony. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.   	39.5	-8	 92391	1793	17.29	6500	10605870	38.5	0.36	10.72	10.5	3.4	1.07	1.09	0.98	0.7	0.95	4.98	5.45	4.48	77.7	74.43	81.2	1.47	0.4	22000	1000	93.3	204400000000	170300000000	0.3	19300	5520000	10	30	60		3.1	28.4	2.3	78840000000	90270000000	63.9	0	44320000000	44010000000	3100000000	5900000000	0	326500	28830	357300	0	2983000000	0	2553000000	38800000000	60350000000	287800000000	4238300	10362100	221	3020000		3310000	845980	16	6090000	66	43 	23 		2850	72600	3000000	2.3	
Papua New Guinea	pp	The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975.

Guinea-Bissau	pu	Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA, after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In August 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president in the second round of presidential polling. Since formally assuming office in October 2005, Vieira has pledged to pursue economic development and national reconciliation.   	12	-15	 36120	350	8.31	250	1442029	19	2.07	37.22	16.53		1.03	1	0.92	0.72	0.94	105.21	115.53	94.57	46.87	45.05	48.75	4.86	10	17000	1200	42.4	1185000000	280000000	2.3	800	480000	82	18	18		0.5	42.4	4				4.7	56000000	52080000	0	0	0	2450			0	0			116000000	176000000	941500000	10600	1300	5	49000			5	2	26000	28	3 	25 			4400	9460000	3.1	
Qatar	qa	Ruled by the al-Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son, the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa al-Thani, overthrew him in a bloodless coup in 1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Oil and natural gas revenues enable Qatar to have one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.   	25.5	51.25	 11437	563	1.64	130	885359	31.7	2.5	15.56	4.72	14.12	1.05	1.04	2.24	2.84	1.87	18.04	21.27	14.63	73.9	71.37	76.57	2.81	0.09			89	23640000000	28070000000	8.8	27400	440000							8.8	17310000000	11310000000	35.6	10	9735000000	9053000000	0	0	790500	33000			30800000000	11610000000	18200000000	0	24900000000	6706000000	21130000000	190900	490300	12	256000	1	230000	204	1	165000	5	3 	2 	1		1230	723000000	10	
Serbia	rb	The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in 1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 was resisted by various paramilitary bands that fought each other as well as the invaders. The group headed by Josip TITO took full control of Yugoslavia upon German expulsion in 1945. Although Communist, his new government and its successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In the early 1990s, post-TITO Yugoslavia began to unravel along ethnic lines: Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina were recognized as independent states in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992 and, under President Slobodan MILOSEVIC, Serbia led various military intervention efforts to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a "Greater Serbia." These actions led to Yugoslavia being ousted from the UN in 1992, but Serbia continued its campaign until signing the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. In 1998-99, massive expulsions by FRY forces and Serb paramilitaries of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo provoked an international response, including the NATO bombing of Belgrade and the stationing of a NATO-led force (KFOR), in Kosovo. Federal elections in the fall of 2000, brought about the ouster of MILOSEVIC and installed Vojislav KOSTUNICA as president. The arrest of MILOSEVIC in 2001 allowed for his subsequent transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to be tried for crimes against humanity. In 2001, the country's suspension from the UN was lifted, and it was once more accepted into UN organizations under the name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo has been governed by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) since June 1999, under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, pending a determination by the international community of its future status. In 2002, the Serbian and Montenegrin components of Yugoslavia began negotiations to forge a looser relationship. In February 2003 lawmakers restructured the country into a loose federation of two republics called Serbia and Montenegro. The Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro included a provision that allowed either republic to hold a referendum after three years that would allow for their independence from the state union. In the spring of 2006, Montenegro took advantage of the provision to undertake a successful independence vote enabling it to secede on 3 June. Two days later, Serbia declared that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro.   	44	21	 88361				9396411	40.4													74	71	76	1.78				96.4	41150000000	19190000000	5.9	4400 for Serbia	2961000	30	46	24	30			15.5	11450000000	11120000000	53.1	1.4	33870000000		12050000000	11230000000	14660	85000			650000000	2550000000					15430000000	2685400	4729600	0						1400000	39	16 	23 	4	4135	37887			
Reunion	re	The Portuguese discovered the uninhabited island in 1513. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French immigration, supplemented by influxes of Africans, Chinese, Malays, and Malabar Indians, gave the island its ethnic mix. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cost the island its importance as a stopover on the East Indies trade route.   	-21.1	55.6	 2517	207	13.94	120	787584	26.9	1.34	18.9	5.49		1.05	1.05	0.98	0.69	0.98	7.63	8.37	6.85	74.18	70.78	77.75	2.45				88.9	4790000000		2.5	6200	299000	13	12	75					554700000	554700000			1190000000	1107000000	0	0	0	18500			0	0			248500000			300000	579200	57	173000	35	127000	29	1	200000	2	2 				1214			
Marshall Islands	rm	After almost four decades under US administration as the easternmost part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association. Compensation claims continue as a result of US nuclear testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and 1962. The Marshall Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) Reagan Missile Test Site, a key installation in the US missile defense network.   	9	168	 11854.3	370.4	11.11	0	60422	20.3	2.25	33.05	4.78	-5.78	1.05	1.04	1.05	0.94	1.04	28.43	31.93	24.76	70.31	68.33	72.39	3.85				93.7	115000000		1	2300	14680	21.4	20.9	57.7				1.8	42000000	40000000															9100000	54700000	86500000	5510	1198	0				6	1	2000	15	4 	11 			64.5			
Romania	ro	The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their autonomy in 1856; they united in 1859 and a few years later adopted the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist "people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in 1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989. Former Communists dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power. Although Romania completed accession talks with the European Union (EU) in December 2004, it must continue to address rampant corruption - while invigorating lagging economic and democratic reforms - to fulfill the requirements for EU accession, scheduled to take place in 2007 or 2008. Romania joined NATO in March of 2004.   	46	25	 237500	225	39.49	30770	22303552	36.6	-0.12	10.7	11.77	-0.13	1.06	1.05	0.99	0.7	0.95	25.5	28.64	22.16	71.63	68.14	75.34	1.37	0.1	6500	350	98.4	183600000000	72700000000	4.5	8200	9310000	31.6	30.7	37.7	25	2.4	27.6	9	29970000000	31370000000	20.3	1.9	51700000000	45160000000	3300000000	380000000	119000	235000			12300000000	18000000000	0	5400000000	27720000000	38150000000	35680000000	4389100	10215400	245	7200000	48	5250000	56188	38	4500000	61	25 	36 	1	11385	198817	985000000	2.47	
Philippines	rp	The Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during the 16th century; they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected President and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a 10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese occupation during WWII, and US forces and Filipinos fought together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the Philippines attained their independence. The 20-year rule of Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a widespread popular rebellion forced him into exile and installed Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several coup attempts, which prevented a return to full political stability and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992 and his administration was marked by greater stability and progress on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998, but was succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges broke down and widespread demonstrations led to his ouster. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term in May 2004. The Philippine Government faces threats from armed communist insurgencies and from Muslim separatists in the south.   	13	122	 300000	36289	19	15500	89468677	22.5	1.8	24.89	5.41	-1.48	1.05	1.04	0.99	0.77	1	22.81	25.59	19.89	70.21	67.32	73.24	3.11	0.1	9000	500	92.6	451300000000	91360000000	5.1	5100	36730000	36	16	48	40	2.3	31.9	7.6	12380000000	15770000	72.3	2.2	47820000000	44480000000	0	0	14360	335000	0	312000	2300000000	2300000000	0	0	41250000000	42660000000	65710000000	3437500	32935900	0	11500000	225	3700000	96500	33	7820000	256	83 	173 	2	897	200037	836900000	0.9	
Puerto Rico	rq	Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter the existing political status.   	18.25	-66.5	 13790	501	3.69	400	3927188	34.7	0.4	12.77	7.65	-1.14	1.05	1.05	0.92	0.76	0.92	9.14	10.32	7.9	78.4	74.46	82.54	1.75		7397		94.1	72700000000		2.5	18600	1300000	3	20	77				6.5	6700000000	9600000000			23030000000	21420000000	0	0	436.1	218000			0	740000000	0	630000000	46900000000			1111900	2682000	127	2700000	32	1021000	132	76	1000000	30	17 	13 		96	25645			
Russia	rs	Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy, was able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th centuries) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding principalities. In the early 17th century, a new Romanov Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism, but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. Since then, Russia has struggled in its efforts to build a democratic political system and market economy to replace the strict social, political, and economic controls of the Communist period. While some progress has been made on the economic front, recent years have seen a recentralization of power under Vladimir PUTIN and the erosion of nascent democratic institutions. A determined guerrilla conflict still plagues Russia in Chechnya and threatens to destabilize the North Caucasus region.   	60	100	 17075200	37653	7.17	46000	142893540	38.4	-0.37	9.95	14.65	1.03	1.06	1.05	0.94	0.46	0.86	15.13	17.43	12.7	67.08	60.45	74.1	1.28	1.1	860000	9000	99.6	1589000000000	740700000000	6.4	11100	74220000	10.3	21.4	68.3	17.8	1.7	38.7	12.7	176700000000	125600000000	12.9	4	931000000000	811500000000	24000000000	14000000000	9150000	2800000	5150000	75000	587000000000	402100000000	157200000000	12000000000			215300000000	39616000	74420000	386	61500000	7306	60500000	1306427	300	23700000	1623	616 	1,007 	52	87157	537289			
Rwanda	rw	In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in the genocide of roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the killing in July 1994, but approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and the former Zaire. Since then, most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but about 10,000 remain in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo and have formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF tried in 1990. Despite substantial international assistance and political reforms - including Rwanda's first local elections in March 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in August and September 2003 - the country continues to struggle to boost investment and agricultural output, and ethnic reconciliation is complicated by the real and perceived Tutsi political dominance. Kigali's increasing centralization and intolerance of dissent, the nagging Hutu extremist insurgency across the border, and Rwandan involvement in two wars in recent years in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to hinder Rwanda's efforts to escape its bloody legacy.   	-2	30	 26338		45.56	90	8648248	18.6	2.43	40.37	16.09		1.03	1.01	0.99	0.67	0.99	89.61	94.71	84.34	47.3	46.26	48.38	5.43	5.1	250000	22000	70.4	12650000000	1817000000	5.2	1500	4600000	90	10	10	60	4.2	24.2	8	509900000	584600000		7	98000000	121100000	0	30000000	0	6000			0	0			98000000	243000000	1400000000	23200		9	601000	2		1588	2	38000	9	4 	5 			12000	53660000	2.9	
Saudi Arabia	sa	In 1902, ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al Saud captured Riyadh and set out on a 30-year campaign to unify the Arabian Peninsula. A son of ABD AL-AZIZ rules the country today, and the country's Basic Law stipulates that the throne shall remain in the hands of the aging sons and grandsons of the kingdom's founder. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after Operation Desert Storm remained a source of tension between the royal family and the public until the US military's near-complete withdrawal to neighboring Qatar in 2003. The first major terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia in several years, which occurred in May and November 2003, prompted renewed efforts on the part of the Saudi government to counter domestic terrorism and extremism, which also coincided with a slight upsurge in media freedom and announcement of government plans to phase in partial political representation. As part of this effort, the government permitted elections - held nationwide from February through April 2005 - for half the members of 179 municipal councils. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.   	25	45	 1960582	2640	1.67	16200	27019731	21.4	2.18	29.34	2.58	-4.94	1.05	1.04	1.33	1.13	1.2	12.81	14.71	10.83	75.67	73.66	77.78	4	0.01			78.8	338000000000	264000000000	6.1	12800	6760000	12	25	63				0.4	143700000000	89650000000	44.2	5.3	145100000000	134900000000	0	0	9475000	1775000	7920000	0	60060000000	60060000000	0	0	165000000000	44930000000	36780000000	3695100	9175800	76	6250000	117	5100000	10335	22	2540000	208	73 	135 	6	1392	152044	18000000000	10

In April 2004 RENE stepped down and Vice President James MICHEL was sworn in as president.   	-4.58333333333333	55.6666666666667	 455	491	2.17		81541	28.1	0.43	16.03	6.29	-5.4	1.03	1.02	0.95	0.47	0.93	15.14	19.16	10.99	72.08	66.69	77.63	1.74				91.9	626000000	722000000	-3	7800	30900	10	19	71				1.6	343300000	332200000	167		241300000	224400000	0	0	0	7600			0	0			312100000	459900000	508000000	21200	54500	4	42000	2	11000	525	1	20000	15	8 	7 			280	14850000	2.1	
South Africa	sf	After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments, but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902). The resulting Union of South Africa operated under a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races. The 1990s brought an end to apartheid politically and ushered in black majority rule.   	-29	24	 1219912	2798	12.1	14980	44187637	24.1	-0.4	18.2	22	-0.16	1.02	1.01	0.95	0.63	0.95	60.66	64.31	56.92	42.73	43.25	42.19	2.2	21.5	5300000	370000	86.4	533200000000	187300000000	4.9	12000	15230000	30	25	45	50	1.1	45.9	4	65910000000	70620000000	35.8	3.6	215900000000	197400000000	10140000000	6739000000	216700	484000			2350000000	2350000000	0	0	50910000000	52970000000	29970000000	4844000	19500000	362	17000000	556	6000000	460572	150	3600000	731	146 	585 		20872	362099	3550000000	1.5	
Senegal	sg	Independent from France in 1960, Senegal was ruled by the Socialist Party for forty years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982, but the envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. A southern separatist group sporadically has clashed with government forces since 1982, but Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa. Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping.   	14	-14	 196190	531	12.51	1200	11987121	19.1	2.34	32.78	9.42		1.03	1.02	0.99	0.88	1	52.94	56.49	49.29	59.25	57.7	60.85	4.38	0.8	44000	3500	40.2	20530000000	7972000000	6.1	1800	4820000	77	23	23	54	2.6	33.5	1.7	1657000000	1926000	46	3.1	1332000000	1239000000	0	0	0	31000			50000000	50000000	0	0	1526000000	2405000000	3529000000	244900	1121300	29	1240000	1	361000	569	1	482000	20	9 	11 		906	13576	117300000	1.4

Slovenia	si	The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.   	46.1166666666667	14.8166666666667	 20273	46.6	8.53	30	2010347	40.6	-0.05	8.98	10.31	0.88	1.07	1.06	1.02	0.63	0.95	4.4	4.99	3.77	76.33	72.63	80.29	1.25	0.1	280	100	99.7	43360000000	35210000000	3.9	21600	920000	6	40	55		3.9	23	2.5	16020000000	16730000000	28.5	3.2	13230000000	12470000000	5811000000	5975000000	11.05	52000			0	1100000000	0	1040000000	18530000000	19620000000	18970000000	812300	1739100	177	805000	48	710000	59090	11	950000	14	6 	8 		1229	38400	370000000	1.7	
Sierra Leone	sl	The government is slowly reestablishing its authority after the 1991 to 2002 civil war that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one-third of the population). The last UN peacekeepers withdrew in December 2005, leaving full responsibility for security with domestic forces, but a new civilian UN office remains to support the government. Mounting tensions related to planned 2007 elections, deteriorating political and economic conditions in Guinea, and the tenuous security situation in neighboring Liberia may present challenges to continuing progress in Sierra Leone's stability.   	8.5	-11.5	 71740	402	7.95	300	6005250	17.4	2.3	45.76	23.03	0.23	1.03	0.96	0.92	0.89	0.94	160.39	177.47	142.8	40.22	38.05	42.46	6.08	7	170000	11000	29.6	4921000000	1128000000	6.3	800	1369000				68	0.5	43.6	1	96000000	351000000			260600000	242400000	0	0	0.8361	6510			0	0			185000000	531000000	1610000000	24000	113200	11	1120000	2	53000	277	1	2005	10	1 	9 	2		11300	14250000	1.7	
San Marino	sm	The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See and Monaco) also claims to be the world's oldest republic.

Singapore	sn	Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819. It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated two years later and became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of the world's most prosperous countries with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading nations of Western Europe.   	1.36666666666667	103.8	 692.7	193	1.47		4492150	37.3	1.42	9.34	4.28	9.12	1.08	1.07	0.95	0.8	0.96	2.29	2.5	2.07	81.71	79.13	84.49	1.06	0.2	4100	200	92.5	124300000000	110600000000	6.4	28100	2280000							0.4	18670000000	18210000000	102.9	9.5	36800000000	33200000000	0	0	8290	800000			0	5320000000	0	2500000000	204800000000		23760000000	1847800	4256800	19	2600000	1	1330000	679369	9	2421800	9	9 				3165	4470000000	4.9	
Somalia	so	The regime of Mohamed SIAD Barre was ousted in January 1991; turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy have followed in the years since. In May of 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence, aided by the overwhelming dominance of a ruling clan and economic infrastructure left behind by British, Russian, and American military assistance programs. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring self-declared autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998, but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government, but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored. The mandate of the Transitional National Government (TNG), created in August 2000 in Arta, Djibouti, expired in August 2003. A two-year peace process, led by the Government of Kenya under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as Transitional Federal President of Somalia and the formation of a transitional government, known as the Somalia Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs). The Somalia TFIs include a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Assembly (TFA), a transitional Prime Minister, Ali Mohamed GHEDI, and a 90-member cabinet. The TFIs are currently divided between Mogadishu and Jowhar, but discussions to co-locate the TFIs in one city are ongoing. Suspicion of Somali links with global terrorism further complicates the picture.   	10	49	 637657	3025	1.64	2000	8863338	17.6	2.85	45.13	16.63		1.03	1.01	1.01	0.73	1	114.89	124.18	105.32	48.47	46.71	50.28	6.76	1	43000		37.8	4809000000		2.4	600	3700000	71	29	29									235600000	219100000	0	0	0	5000			0	0			241000000	576000000	3000000000	200000	500000	12	470000	4	135000	2	3	89000	65	7 	58 			22100	22340000	0.9	
Spain	sp	Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II, but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the EU in 1986), have given Spain one of the most dynamic economies in Europe and made it a global champion of freedom. Continuing challenges include Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) terrorism and relatively high unemployment.   	40	-4	 504782	4964	27.18	37800	40397842	39.9	0.13	10.06	9.72	0.99	1.07	1.06	1.01	0.72	0.96	4.37	4.76	3.95	79.65	76.32	83.2	1.28	0.7	140000	1000	97.9	1029000000000	1019000000000	3.4	25500	20670000	5.3	30.1	64.6		2.8	25.2	3.4	440900000000	448400000000	42.9	0.7	247300000000	231200000000	7500000000	8700000000	24540	1544000	135100	1582000	216000000	23270000000	0	17260000000	194300000000	271800000000	970700000000	17934500	38646800	924	13100000		16200000	1380541	56	17142198	157	96 	61 	8	14873	666292	9000000	1.2

Sudan	su	Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956. Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in northern economic, political, and social domination of largely non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in 1972, but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related effects resulted in more than 4 million people displaced and, according to rebel estimates, more than 2 million deaths over a period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with the signing of several accords; a final Naivasha peace treaty of January 2005 granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years, after which a referendum for independence is scheduled to be held. A separate conflict that broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003 has resulted in at least 200,000 deaths and nearly 2 million displaced; as of late 2005, peacekeeping troops were struggling to stabilize the situation. Sudan also has faced large refugee influxes from neighboring countries, primarily Ethiopia and Chad, and armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of government support have chronically obstructed the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations.   	15	30	 2505810	853	6.78	18630	41236378	18.3	2.55	34.53	8.97	-0.02	1.05	1.04	1	1.15	1.02	61.05	61.88	60.18	58.92	57.69	60.21	4.72	2.3	400000	23000	61.1	85650000000	22750000000	7	2100	11000000	80	7	13	40			9	6182000000	5753000	107	8.5	3165000000	2943000000	0	0	401300	70000	275000	0	0	0			6989000000	5028000000	27340000000	1028900	1048600	14	7550000	3	2380000	1	2	1140000	88	15 	73 	1	5978	11900	587000000	3

Sweden	sw	A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not participated in any war in almost two centuries. An armed neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000-02 by the global economic downturn, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Indecision over the country's role in the political and economic integration of Europe delayed Sweden's entry into the EU until 1995, and waived the introduction of the euro in 1999.   	62	15	 449964	3218	5.93	1150	9016596	40.9	0.16	10.27	10.31	1.66	1.06	1.06	1.03	0.77	0.98	2.76	2.92	2.59	80.51	78.29	82.87	1.66	0.1	3600	100	99	268000000000	348100000000	2.7	29800	4490000	2	24	74		3.7	20.1	0.5	210500000000	205900000000	50.4	1.6	127900000000	131800000000	11500000000	24300000000	2441	346100	203700	553100	0	980000000	0	968000000	126600000000	104400000000	516100000000	6447000	9775000	267	8250000	169	4600000	2701456	29	6800000	255	155 	100 	2	11481	424981	5510000000	1.5	
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands	sx	The islands lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration since 1908, except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia, was a 19th and early 20th century whaling station. Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died in 1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today, the station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. The islands have large bird and seal populations, and, recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended the exclusive fishing zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island.   	-54.5	-37	 3903			0																																																								0		0		213											
Syria	sy	Following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, France administered Syria until its independence in 1946. The country lacked political stability, however, and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic, but in September 1961 the two entities separated and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel, and over the past decade Syria and Israel have held occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of President al-ASAD in July 2000, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as president by popular referendum. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April of 2005.   	35	38	 185180	193	24.8	13330	18881361	20.7	2.3	27.76	4.81		1.06	1.06	1.05	0.9	1.05	28.61	28.85	28.36	70.32	69.01	71.7	3.4	0.1	500	200	76.9	72330000000	25840000000	4.5	3900	5120000	30	27	43	20			5	6392000000	7613000000	40.1	7	29530000000	28260000000	0	0	403800	240000	285000		6950000000	6950000000	0	0	6344000000	5973000000	8566000000	2660000	2345000	17	4150000	44	1050000	64	1	800000	92	26 	66 	7	2711	91795	858000000	5.9	
Switzerland	sz	The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations, but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.   	47	8	 41290		9.91	250	7523934	40.1	0.43	9.71	8.49	3.12	1.05	1.08	1.02	0.7	0.97	4.34	4.84	3.81	80.51	77.69	83.48	1.43	0.4	13000	100	99	241800000000	367000000000	1.8	32300	3800000	4.6	26.3	69.1		2.6	25.2	1.2	138100000000	143600000000	52	3	63400000000	55860000000	33200000000	30100000000	1950	258900	10420	289500	0	3209000000	0	3093000000	148600000000	135000000000	856000000000	5262600	6275000	119	7100000	115	3310000	1823012	44	4944438	65	42 	23 	2	4583	71220	2548000000	1	
Trinidad and Tobago	td	First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.   	11	-61	 5128	362	14.62	40	1065842	31.2	-0.87	12.9	10.57	-11.07	1.05	1.06	1.1	0.81	1.07	25.05	26.86	23.15	66.76	65.71	67.86	1.74	3.2	29000	1900	98.6	18010000000	13020000000	7	16700	620000				21			6.9	4500000000	4060000	43	9	6076000000	5651000000	0	0	150000	29000			24700000000	12790000000	11790000000	0	9161000000	6011000000	2767000000	321300	651200	22	680000	6	425000	17171	17	160000	6	3 	3 			8320	66720000	0.6

Thailand	th	A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US ally following the conflict. Thailand is currently facing armed violence in its three Muslim-majority southernmost provinces.   	15	100	 514000	3219	27.54	49860	64631595	31.9	0.68	13.87	7.04		1.05	1.05	0.98	0.84	0.98	19.49	20.77	18.15	72.25	69.95	74.68	1.64	1.5	570000	58000	92.6	560700000000	183900000000	4.5	8300	35360000	49	14	37	10	2.8	32.4	4.5	30640000000	31760000000	47.6	9.1	114700000000	107300000000	315000000	980000000	230000	851000			22280000000	29150000000	0	5200000000	105800000000	107000000000	52460000000	6797000	27379000	544	13960000	111	15190000	786226	15	8420000	108	66 	42 	3	4071	57403	1775000000	1.8	
Tajikistan	ti	The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of 1917. Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely contested and not fully reestablished until 1925. Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and it is now in the process of strengthening its democracy and transitioning to a free market economy after its 1992-1997 civil war. There have been no major security incidents in recent years, although the country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Attention by the international community in the wake of the war in Afghanistan has brought increased economic development assistance, which could create jobs and increase stability in the long term. Tajikistan is in the early stages of seeking World Trade Organization membership and has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace.   	39	71	 143100		6.52	7220	7320815	20	2.19	32.65	8.25	-2.48	1.05	1.02	0.99	0.79	0.99	106.49	117.83	94.59	64.94	62.03	68	4	0.1	200	100	99.4	8730000000	1887000000	8	1200	3700000	67.2	7.5	25.3	64	3.2	25.2	7.1	442300000	542600000		8.2	16500000000	15050000000	3874000000	4810000000	354.8	25000			30000000	1400000000	0	1400000000	950000000	1250000000	888000000	245200	47600	20	1291000	13	820000	63	4	5000	40	17 	23 		482	27767	35400000	3.9	
Turks and Caicos Islands	tk	The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown colony upon Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands remain a British overseas territory.   	21.75	-71.5833333333333	 430	389	2.33		21152	27.5	2.82	21.84	4.21	10.54	1.05	1.04	1.11	0.83	1.07	15.18	17.55	12.7	74.73	72.48	77.08	3.05				98	216000000		4.9	11500	4848							4	47000000	33600000			5000000	4650000	0	0	0	80			0	0						5700	1700	9	8000	0		1488	14		8	6 	2 			121

Togo	to	French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, continued to rule well into the 21st century. Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government continued to be dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967. Togo has come under fire from international organizations for human rights abuses and is plagued by political unrest. While most bilateral and multilateral aid to Togo remains frozen, the EU initiated a partial resumption of cooperation and development aid to Togo in late 2004 based upon commitments by Togo to expand opportunities for political opposition and liberalize portions of the economy. Upon his death in February 2005, President EYADEMA was succeeded by his son Faure GNASSINGBE. The succession, supported by the military and in contravention of the nation's constitution, was challenged by popular protest and a threat of sanctions from regional leaders. GNASSINGBE succumbed to pressure and in April 2005 held elections that legitimized his succession.   	8	1.16666666666667	 56785	56	44.2	70	5548702	18.3	2.72	37.01	9.83		1.03	1.01	0.95	0.69	0.96	60.63	68.17	52.87	57.42	55.41	59.49	4.96	4.1	110000	10000	60.9	8965000000	1999000000	1	1700	1740000	65	5	30	32			6	251300000	292900000			165900000	654300000	0	500000000	0	8500			0	0			768000000	1047000000	2000000000	60600	220000	15	940000	3	73000	205	3	221000	9	2 	7 		568	7520	29980000	1.6	
Sao Tome and Principe	tp	Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late 15th century, the islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with plantation slave labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. Although independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. Though the first free elections were held in 1991, the political environment has been one of continued instability with frequent changes in leadership and coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. The recent discovery of oil in the Gulf of Guinea is likely to have a significant impact on the country's economy.   	1	7	 1001	209	8.33	100	193413	16.2	3.15	40.25	6.47	-2.32	1.03	1.03	0.94	0.85	0.98	41.83	43.74	39.86	67.31	65.73	68.95	5.62				79.3	214000000		6	1200					54			15.2	26390000	59480000			15000000	13950000	0	0	0	650			0	0			8000000	38000000	318000000	7000	4800	7	38000	2	23000	1021	1	20000	2	2 				320	581729	0.8	
Tunisia	ts	Following independence from France in 1956, President Habib BOURGUIBA established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. Tunisia has long taken a moderate, non-aligned stance in its foreign relations. Domestically, it has sought to defuse rising pressure for a more open political society.   	34	9	 163610	1148	17.05	3940	10175014	27.8	0.99	15.52	5.13	-0.5	1.07	1.07	1.01	0.91	1.02	23.84	26.7	20.77	75.12	73.4	76.96	1.74	0.1	1000	200	74.3	83540000000	30940000000	4.3	8300	3410000	55	23	22	7.4	2.3	31.8	2.1	7322000000	8304000000	59.1	0.9	11560000000	10760000000	10000000	5000000	76000	90000			2150000000	3840000000	0	1580000000	10300000000	12860000000	16090000000	1203500	3563000	29	2060000	26	920000	426	1	835000	30	14 	16 		2153	18997	356000000	1.5	
East Timor	tt	The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied East Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of East Timor. An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an independent state.   	-8.83333333333333	125.916666666667	 15007	706	8.2	1065	1062777	20.8	2.08	26.99	6.24		1.05	1.03	1.04	0.95	1.04	45.89	52.03	39.44	66.26	63.96	68.67	3.53				58.6	370000000		1	400					42			1.8	107700000	73000000		8.5			0	0														0				215		1000	8	3 	5 	9		5000	4400000		
Turkey	tu	Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants of the defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was later honored with the title Ataturk, or "Father of the Turks." Under his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950 election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980), which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the ouster - popularly dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the then Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives. After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents largely withdrew from Turkey, mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the European Community; over the past decade, it has undertaken many reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy, enabling it to begin accession membership talks with the European Union.   	39	35	 780580	7200	29.81	52150	70413958	28.1	1.06	16.62	5.97		1.05	1.04	1.03	0.84	1.02	39.69	43.27	35.93	72.62	70.18	75.18	1.92	0.1			86.5	572000000000	332500000000	5.6	8200	24700000	35.9	22.8	41.2	20	2.3	30.7	8.2	93580000000	115300000000	68	5.9	133600000000	140300000000	600000000	1200000000	50000	715100	46110	616500	560000000	22600000000	0	15750000000	72490000000	101200000000	170100000000	19125200	34707500	129	11300000	635	20900000	753394	50	5500000	117	89 	28 	18	8697	354421	12155000000	5.3	
Tuvalu	tv	In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv" for $50 million in royalties over a 12-year period.   	-8	178	 26	24			11810	24.6	1.51	22.18	7.11		1.05	1.04	0.95	0.61	0.95	19.47	22.27	16.52	68.32	66.08	70.66	2.98					12200000		3	1100	7000							5	22500000	11200000															1000000			700	0	2	4000	0			1	1300	1		1 			8			
Taiwan	tw	In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan. Taiwan reverted to Chinese control after World War II. Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1946 constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades, the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the native population within the governing structure. In 2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this period, the island prospered and became one of East Asia's economic "Tigers." The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of eventual unification - as well as domestic political and economic reform.   	23.5	121	 35980	1566.3	24		23036087	34.6	0.61	12.56	6.48		1.1	1.09	1.03	0.99	1.04	6.29	6.97	5.55	77.43	74.67	80.47	1.57				96.1	631200000000	323400000000	3.8	27600	10600000	6	35.8	58.2	0.9	6.7	41.1	2.3	41670000000	50260000000	33.6	4.1	218300000000	206100000000	0	0	8354	915000			970000000	8450000000	0	7480000000	189400000000	181600000000	87500000000	13529900	25089600	601	16000000	29	8800000	3838383	8	13800000	42	38 	4 	3	2497	37299	7930000000	2.4	
Turkmenistan	tx	Annexed by Russia between 1865 and 1885, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic in 1924. It achieved its independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. President Saparmurat NIYAZOV retains absolute control over the country and opposition is not tolerated. Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this underdeveloped country if extraction and delivery projects were to be expanded. The Turkmenistan Government is actively seeking to develop alternative petroleum transportation routes in order to break Russia's pipeline monopoly.   	40	60	 488100		4.51	18000	5042920	21.8	1.83	27.61	8.6	-0.75	1.05	1.06	0.96	0.62	0.98	72.56	76.9	68	61.83	58.43	65.41	3.37	0.1	200	100	98.8	39540000000	13990000000	4	8000	2320000	48.2	13.8	37	58	2.6	31.7	10.5	1401000000	1542000000		22	11410000000	8847000000	1136000000	0	203400	80000			54600000000	15500000000	38600000000	0	4700000000	4175000000	2400000000	376100	52000	26	1225000	4	820000	557		36000	29	22 	7 	1	2440	24000	90000000	3.4	
Tanzania	tz	Shortly after independence, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form the nation of Tanzania in 1964. One-party rule came to an end in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.   	-6	35	 945087	1424	4.23	1840	37445392	17.7	1.83	37.71	16.39	-3.05	1.03	1	0.97	0.76	0.98	96.48	105.64	87.05	45.64	44.93	46.37	4.97	8.8	1600000	160000	78.2	27070000000	12120000000	0	700	19220000	80	20	20	36	2.8	30.1	4.3	2235000000	2669000000	65.8	8.4	3152000000	2959000000	0	28000000	0	22000			0	0			1581000000	2391000000	8178000000	149100	1640000	25	8800000	3	103000	9241	6	333000	124	11 	113 		3690	78891	21200000	0.2	
Uganda	ug	Uganda achieved independence from the UK in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100,000 lives. During the 1990s, the government promulgated non-party presidential and legislative elections.   	1	32	 236040		21.57	90	28195754	15	3.37	47.35	12.24	-1.4	1.03	1.01	1.01	0.76	1	66.15	69.51	62.69	52.67	51.68	53.69	6.71	4.1	530000	78000	69.9	48730000000	7909000000	4	1800	13170000	82	5	13	35	4	21	8.1	1845000000	1904000000	64.3	9	1729000000	1448000000	160000000	0	0	10000			0	0			768000000	1608000000	4973000000	71600	1165000	42	5000000	8	500000	2496	2	200000	31	5 	26 		1244	70746	192800000	2.2	
United Kingdom	uk	As the dominant industrial and maritime power of the 19th century, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two World Wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy; it currently is weighing the degree of its integration with continental Europe. A member of the EU, it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union for the time being. Constitutional reform is also a significant issue in the UK. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999, but the latter is suspended due to wrangling over the peace process.   	54	-2	 244820	12429	23.23	1700	60609153	39.3	0.28	10.71	10.13	2.18	1.05	1.05	1.02	0.75	0.98	5.08	5.67	4.47	78.54	76.09	81.13	1.66	0.2	51000	500	99	1830000000000	2228000000000	1.8	30300	30070000	1.5	19.1	79.5	17	2.1	28.5	2.1	881400000000	951000000000	43.1	-1.9	369900000000	346100000000	3000000000	5100000000	2393000	1722000	1498000	1084000	102800000000	95150000000	15750000000	2700000000	372700000000	483700000000	7107000000000	32943000	61091000	653	84500000	228	30500000	4688307	400	37800000	471	334 	137 	11	17156	387674	42000000	2.4	
Ukraine	up	Ukraine was the center of the first Slavic state, Kievan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions, Kievan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kievan Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to bring about a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two artificial famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest "Orange Revolution" in the closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. The new government presents its citizens with hope that the country may at last attain true freedom and prosperity.   	49	32	 603700	2782	53.8	22080	46710816	39.2	-0.6	8.82	14.39	-0.43	1.07	1.05	0.92	0.52	0.86	9.9	11.48	8.22	69.98	64.71	75.59	1.17	1.4	360000	20000	99.7	340400000000	75140000000	2.4	7200	22670000	24	32	44	29	3.4	24.8	13.5	23590000000	22980000000	17	3.2	181300000000	176000000000	1000000000	255000000	85660	491700			20300000000	75800000000	3900000000	59800000000			23930000000	12142000	13735000	427	45050000	33	18050000	167501	260	5278100	499	193 	306 	10	22473	169739	617900000	1.4	
United States	us	Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. The economy is marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.   	38	-97	 9631420	19924	18.01	223850	298444215	36.5	0.91	14.14	8.26	3.18	1.05	1.05	1	0.72	0.97	6.43	7.09	5.74	77.85	75.02	80.82	2.09	0.6	950000	14000	99	12360000000000	12490000000000	3.5	41800	149300000				12	1.8	30.5	3.2	2119000000000	2466000000000	64.7	3.2	3892000000000	3656000000000	23970000000	30390000000	7610000	20030000	1048000	13150000	539000000000	633600000000	24190000000	114100000000	927500000000	1727000000000	8837000000000	268000000	194479364	31	575000000	2218	219000000	195138696	7000	203824428	14858	5,119 	9,739 	149	226605	6407637	518100000000	4.06	
Burkina Faso	uv	Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Burkina Faso's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries.   	13	-2	 274200		17.66	250	13902972	16.5	3	45.62	15.6		1.03	1.01	0.99	0.67	0.99	91.35	99.17	83.3	48.85	47.33	50.42	6.47	4.2	300000	29000	26.6	16950000000	5405000000	4.5	1300	5000000	90	10	10	45	2	46.8	6.4	1033000000	1382000000		14	375600000	349300000	0	0	0	8000			0	0			395000000	992000000	1850000000	81400	572200	23	394020	1	131340	373	1	53200	34	2 	32 		622	12506	74830000	1.3	
Uruguay	uy	Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold, soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important commercial center. Annexed by Brazil as a separate province in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of President BATLLE in the early 20th century established widespread political, social, and economic reforms. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to agree to military control of his administration in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold throughout the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center EP-FA Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously held by the Colorado and Blanco parties. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.   	-33	-56	 176220	660	7.77	2100	3431932	32.7	0.46	13.91	9.05	-0.25	1.04	1.03	0.98	0.69	0.95	11.61	12.9	10.27	76.33	73.12	79.65	1.89	0.3	6000	500	98	32960000000	13240000000	6.5	9600	1520000	14	16	70	22	3.7	25.8	4.7	4468000000	4845000	81.9	8.5	8611000000	7762000000	900000000	654000000	435	38000			0	60000000	0	65000000	3550000000	3540000000	13240000000	1000000	652000	291	1970000	62	782000	112968	14	680000	64	8 	56 		2073	77732	371200000	2.1	
Uzbekistan	uz	Russia conquered Uzbekistan in the late 19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after World War I was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic set up in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum reserves. Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants, economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and democratization.   	41	64	 447400		10.51	42810	27307134	22.7	1.7	26.36	7.84	-1.5	1.05	1.04	0.98	0.69	0.98	69.99	74.14	65.64	64.58	61.19	68.14	2.91	0.1	11000	500	99.3	48240000000	9860000000	7.2	1800	14260000	44	20	36	28	3.6	22	6.9	2815000000	2917000000	36.1	7.7	46520000000	48450000000	5360000000	10550000000	152000	120000			55800000000	49300000000	6500000000	0	5000000000	3800000000	5032000000	1717100	544100	37	10800000	4	6400000	7124	42	880000	61	34 	27 		3950	81600	200000000	2

Venezuela	ve	Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Current concerns include: a weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a politicized military, drug-related violence along the Colombian border, increasing internal drug consumption, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.   	8	-66	 912050	2800	2.85	5750	25730435	26	1.38	18.71	4.92		1.08	1.07	1.01	0.83	1.02	21.54	24.58	18.27	74.54	71.49	77.81	2.23	0.7	110000	4100	93.4	153700000000	106100000000	9.3	6100	12310000	13	23	64	47	0.8	36.5	16	39630000000	41270000000	34.2	7.2	87440000000	81320000000	0	0	3081000	530000	2100000		29700000000	29700000000	0	0	52730000000	24630000000	41510000000	3346500	8421000	212	10750000	66	4100000	57875	16	3040000	375	129 	246 	1	682	96155	1610000000	1.2	
British Virgin Islands	vi	First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the English in 1672. The islands were part of the British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872-1960; they were granted autonomy in 1967. The economy is closely tied to the larger and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is the legal currency.   	18.5	-64.5	 153	80	20		23098	31.4	1.97	14.89	4.42	9.22	1.05	1.03	1.06	1.1	1.05	16.72	19.5	13.79	76.68	75.56	77.84	1.72				97.8	853400000		1	38500	12770							2.5	121500000	115500000			34550000	32130000	0	0	0	410			0	0					36100000	11700	8000	6	9000	1	4000	480	16	4000	3	2 	1 			177			
Vietnam	vm	The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under Communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of conservative leadership policies. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's "doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive, export-driven industries. The country continues to experience protests from various groups - such as the Protestant Montagnard ethnic minority population of the Central Highlands and the Hoa Hao Buddhists in southern Vietnam over religious persecution. Montagnard grievances also include the loss of land to Vietnamese settlers.   	16	106	 329560	3444	20.14	30000	84402966	25.9	1.02	16.86	6.22	-0.42	1.07	1.08	0.98	0.64	0.98	25.14	25.54	24.72	70.85	68.05	73.85	1.91	0.4	220000	9000	90.3	232200000000	43750000000	8.4	2800	44390000	56.8	37	6.2	19.5	3.6	29.9	8.3	11640000000	12950000000	48.2	17.2	46200000000	52000000000			400000	216000			6342000000	6342000000	0		32230000000	36880000000	20160000000	10124900	4960000	101	8200000	6	3570000	3611	5	5870000	32	26 	6 		2600	222179	650000000	2.5	
Virgin Islands	vq	During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided into two territorial units, one English and the other Danish. Sugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1917, the US purchased the Danish portion, which had been in economic decline since the abolition of slavery in 1848.   	18.3333333333333	-64.8333333333333	 1910	188	5.71		108605	37.1	-0.12	13.96	6.43	-8.73	1.06	1.02	0.9	0.79	0.91	7.86	8.93	6.72	79.05	75.24	83.09	2.17				90-95	1577000000		2	14500	43980	1	19	80				2.2					1040000000	967300000	0	0	14650	105000			0	0						70900	41000	22	107000	5	68000	3818	50	30000	2	2 				1257			
Holy See (Vatican City)	vt	Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom, international development, the Middle East, terrorism, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Catholic faith.   	41.9	12.45	 0.44			0	932		0.01																			100													245200000	260400000					0													5120		9		1		36											
Namibia	wa	South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World War II, when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war of independence for the area that was soon named Namibia, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. Namibia won its independence in 1990 and has been governed by SWAPO since. Hifikepunye POHAMBA was elected president in November 2004 in a landslide victory replacing Sam NUJOMA who led the country during its first 14 years of self rule.   	-22	17	 825418	1572	0.99	80	2044147	20	0.59	24.32	18.86	0.47	1.03	1.02	1.01	0.84	1.01	48.1	51.99	44.09	43.39	44.46	42.29	3.06	21.3	210000	16000	84	14230000000	4976000000	3.5	7000	820000	47	20	33				2.3	1945000000	2039000000	32.7		1464000000	2372000000	55000000	1065000000	0	16000			0	0			2040000000	2350000000	712900000	127900	286100	45	232000	8	60000	3273	2	75000	137	21 	116 		2382	42237	149500000	2.3	
West Bank	zx	The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority (PA) as part of the interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron, the Israel-PLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. The DOP provided that Israel would retain responsibility during the transitional period for external and internal security and for public order of settlements and Israeli citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and West Bank began in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but were derailed by a second intifada that broke out in September 2000. In April 2003 the Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. The proposed date for a permanent status agreement has been postponed indefinitely due to violence and accusations that both sides have not followed through on their commitments. Longtime Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT died in November 2004 and Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA President in January 2005, bringing hope of a turning point in the conflict. Israel and the PA agreed in February 2005 to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments, focused on security issues, in an effort to move the peace process forward. Progress has been slow because of different interpretations of the verbal agreement by the two sides.   	32	35.25	 5860		16.9	150	2460492	18.3	3.06	31.67	3.92	2.8	1.06	1.05	1.05	0.74	1.04	19.15	21.12	17.05	73.27	71.5	75.15	4.28				91.9	1800000000		6.2	1100	614000	18.4	24	57.6	46			2.2	964000000	1340000000															270000000		0	357300	974300	21		8			8	160000	3	3 				4158			
Wallis and Futuna	wf	The Futuna island group was discovered by the Dutch in 1616 and Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the French who declared a protectorate over the islands in 1842.

Wake Island	wq	The US annexed Wake Island in 1899 for a cable station. An important air and naval base was constructed in 1940-41. In December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake was developed as a stopover and refueling site for military and commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's airstrip has been used by the US military, as well as for emergency landings. Currently, access to the atoll is restricted to official government business.   	19.2833333333333	166.65	 6.5	19.3		0																																																								0		0 					1	1 							
Samoa	ws	New Zealand occupied the German protectorate of Western Samoa at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It continued to administer the islands as a mandate and then as a trust territory until 1962, when the islands became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish independence in the 20th century.

Swaziland	wz	Autonomy for the Swazis of southern Africa was guaranteed by the British in the late 19th century; independence was granted in 1968. Student and labor unrest during the 1990s pressured the monarchy (one of the oldest on the continent) to grudgingly allow political reform and greater democracy. Swaziland recently surpassed Botswana as the country with the world's highest known rates of HIV/AIDS infection.   	-26.5	31.5	 17363		10.25	500	1136334	18.5	-0.23	27.41	29.74		1.03	1.02	0.92	0.66	0.95	71.85	75.25	68.34	32.62	32.1	33.17	3.53	38.8	220000	17000	81.6	5658000000	2117000000	1.8	5000	155700				69	1	50.2	4	805600000	957100000		3.7	392000000	1161000000	0	821400000	0	3500			0	0			1991000000	2149000000	357000000	46200	113000	8	170000	12	23000	2401	5	36000	18	1 	17 		301	3594	41600000	1.4	
Yemen	ym	North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border.   	15	48	 527970	1906	2.91	5500	21456188	16.6	3.46	42.89	8.3		1.05	1.04	1.04	0.96	1.04	59.88	64.55	54.98	62.12	60.23	64.11	6.58	0.1	12000		50.2	19370000000	14340000000	2.4	900	5830000				45.2	3	25.9	11.8	5616000000	5719000000	34.4	3	3848000000	2827000000	0	0	387500	80000	370300		0	0	0	0	6387000000	4190000000	5347000000	798100	1072000	9	1050000	7	470000	166	1	220000	46	16 	30 			65144	992200000	6.4	
Zambia	za	The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anti-corruption campaign in 2002, which resulted in the prosecution of former President Frederick CHILUBA and some officials of his administration.   	-15	30	 752614		6.99	1560	11502010	16.5	2.11	41	19.93		1.03	1.01	0.99	0.74	0.99	86.84	94.08	79.37	40.03	39.76	40.31	5.39	16.5	920000	89000	80.6	10590000000	5351000000	5.1	900	4800000	85	6	9	86	1.1	41	18.3	1688000000	1866000000	71.5	7.9	8347000000	5345000000	2000000000	0	130.2	12250			0	0			1947000000	1934000000	4641000000	88400	300000	28	1200000	9	277000	2789	5	231000	111	10 	101 		2173	91440	121700000	1.8	
Atlantic Ocean		The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal (Germany), Oresund (Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of Gibraltar (Morocco-Spain), and the Saint Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US) are important strategic access waterways. The decision by the International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude.   	0	-25	76762000	111866																																																																									
Zimbabwe	zi	The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. Opposition and labor strikes in 2003 were unsuccessful in pressuring MUGABE to retire early; security forces continued their brutal repression of regime opponents. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary election, allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate the Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April 2005, Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition, according to UN estimates.   	-20	30	 390580		8.24	1740	12236805	19.9	0.62	28.01	21.84		1.03	1.02	1	0.88	1	51.71	54.5	48.83	39.29	40.39	38.16	3.13	24.6	1800000	170000	90.7	28370000000	3207000000	-7	2300	3940000	66	10	24	80	1.97	40.42	266.8	1409000000	1905000000	109.8	3.6	8877000000	11220000000	0	3300000000	0	22500	0	23000	0	0			1644000000	2059000000	5216000000	317000	423600	28	1140000	16	370000	6582	6	820000	403	17 	386 		3077	97440	124700000	4	
Iles Eparses	zz	Iles Eparses are a group of five French entities - Bassas da India, Europa Island, Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova Island, and Tromelin Island - which on 1 April 1960 came under the authority of the Minister in charge of overseas possessions. On 19 September 1960 by decree, the islands were transferred to the charge of the Prefet of Reunion where they remained until 3 January 2005 when they were transferred by another decree to the Senior Administrator of the Territory of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF). 	0	0	80																																																																		4		4
